            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HE, that would undertake to ſhew us a new or better way to
Heaven, then either we or our <hi>Forefathers</hi> have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with,
ought in all reaſon to recommend himſelf (as the Apoſtles did) by ſome
other <hi>Authority</hi> then a bare pretence to <hi>Scripture,</hi> which
every body claims as well as he: unleſs we would <hi>be toſſed too and
fro</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>and carried about with every
Wind of Doctrine,</hi> with the various <hi>Lights</hi> of all
<hi>Reformers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> was this new undertaker; who had neither
<hi>Miſſion</hi> from Heaven, nor conſent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Biſhops to Authorize his <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor yet any great mind to dye
a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the ſame; as will appear in the enſuing
Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Now I pray obſerve theſe words of <hi>Mas William King,</hi>
page 21. of his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Mr. <hi>Manby,</hi> viz.—<hi>We own
what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, that both true Doctrine and external and lawful</hi>
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>are generally neceſſary to a regular Preacher of the
Goſpel, and if either of theſe are wanting, the Perſon is not to be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here if it can be demonſtrated that <hi>Cranmer</hi> had no
<hi>Orders</hi> either as Prieſt or Biſhop, but only to celebrate
<hi>Maſs,</hi> to preach the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to bind
and abſolve Sinners; there is an end of the Controverſie. If he had no
<hi>Miſſion</hi> at all to preach the Doctrine of <hi>XXXIX. Articles,</hi>
then by <hi>Mas William King</hi>'s own Confeſſion, <hi>he was not to be
received.</hi> And for this (Reader) be pleaſed to read from page 81. of this
<hi>Catechiſm</hi> to page 91.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47525:3"/>
               <hi>And where he ſays,</hi> page 25 of his
<hi>Anſwer,</hi> that <hi>Cranmer in all he did, had the unanimous vote and
conſent of the major part of the Convocation, the univerſal
ſubmiſſion of the Clergy, and approbation of the People,</hi> &amp;c. And
a little after, <hi>but if the Clergy in a National Council, and the people in
obedience to them, or from their own Inclinations did comply in earneſt, what
an idle queſtion is it</hi> (for Mr. <hi>M.</hi>) <hi>to ask, by what
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Cranmer <hi>condemned that Church from whom he received
his</hi> Miſſion <hi>and Holy</hi> Orders? <hi>when ſhe concurred in all
he did, and approved, nay, made all the Alterations in her Liturgy, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Conſtitutions that were made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it appear, that all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops,
except a very few (during the Reign of <hi>Henry VIII.</hi>) were utterly
againſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Reformation;</hi> and that almoſt all the
Biſhops under <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI.</hi> were turned out of their Sees for
diſſenting from it, and others ſubſtituted in their places; what
ſhall we think of Mr. <hi>Kings</hi> Confidence thus impoſing upon his
Readers? What ſhall become of his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> the
whole ſtrength whereof depends upon theſe words, <hi>that the major Vote of
the Convocation concurred in all he did, and approved all the Alterations that
were made,</hi> page 25.</p>
            <p>Read <hi>Burnet</hi> relating the concerns of the Church upon King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Succeſſion to the Crown; and you ſhall find all affairs
diſpatch'd by the Privy Council and two Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> generally diſſenting. <hi>The Convocation</hi> (ſays
<hi>Heylin</hi> ad annum 1547. the firſt year of King <hi>Edward</hi>)
<hi>was not impowr'd to act in any publick buſineſs for ought appearing on
Record.</hi> Hiſt. Reform. p. 50. Third Edition.</p>
            <p>And further, Note what he ſays (ad annum 1551. <hi>the fifth
year of King</hi> Edward) <hi>but notwithſtanding the remove of ſo many
Biſhops, there ſtill remained one rub in the way which did much retard the
Progreſs of the</hi> Reformation, <hi>the Princeſs</hi> Mary <hi>having
been bred up in the Romiſh Religion could not be won by any Perſwaſions
to change her Mind,</hi> &amp;c. page 102.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47525:3"/>
               <hi>Burnet</hi> ſays, ſeveral of the Biſhops
under King <hi>Edward</hi> ſubmitted to the Reformation againſt their
Conſciences. Which only amounts to what I affirm in this
<hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that the Reformation was not the Act and Deed of the
<hi>old Clergy,</hi> but impos'd on the Nation by the Power and Intereſt of a
few perſons for their own advantage.</p>
            <p>Let us imagine, if the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had
proſpered, and then ſummoned an Aſſembly of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Biſhops to reform the Church, as he and his Party had deſigned, and (they
generally diſſenting) ſhould carry all things by ſtrong hand; whether
ſuch a <hi>Reformation,</hi> paſſing with the conſent of a few
Biſhops and a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Clergymen, could be reputed the Act aod Deed of the
Church of <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you would ſee an Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Kings</hi>
modeſt way of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> and Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> read <hi>pag.</hi> 35. of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> where he tells
you of the <hi>Popes wicked Management of the Goods of the Church, and giving
the Patrimony of the Church to Lay-men, to uſeleſs and idle Monks and
Fryars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And for an Inſtance of his <hi>Loyalty,</hi> ſee <hi>page</hi>
37. where he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Cranmer,</hi> for ſubſcribing to a Letter for
Excluding his lawful Sovereign, the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> from
Succeſſion to the Crown. <hi>It was a point of Law</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in
which</hi> Cranmer <hi>was not ſingular. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>takes the liberty to
queſtion Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>Title, and ſure it was no greater fault
in</hi> Cranmer <hi>to queſtion Queen</hi> Marys <hi>after the Opinion of the
Judges given againſt her</hi> (mark that.) <hi>There is a great difference
between Rebellion againſt the King of undoubted Title, and being engaged on a
ſide where the Title is really doubtful,</hi> &amp;c. that is to ſay,
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was engaged on the ſide of Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> Queen
<hi>Marys</hi> Title being really doubtful. And why was it doubtful? Mr.
<hi>King</hi> gives you the reaſon, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. <hi>It was not
only</hi> Cranmers <hi>Opinion, but the Opinion of moſt learned men in</hi>
Europe, <hi>that her Mothers Marriage with King</hi> Henry <hi>was null.</hi>
Now whether he underſtands this matter ſo well as he thinks, ſhall appear
in the ſecond part of this <hi>Catechiſm.</hi>

               <hi>Good Reader,</hi> I humbly deſire this Favour of thee, to

<hi>good Lord deliver us.</hi> Hadſt thou never ſo many Vertues, yet to
live and dye in <hi>Schiſm,</hi> is as much as thy Soul is worth. Think upon
the difference betwixt <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity;</hi> the conſideration
whereof muſt oblige thee to ſlight and deſpiſe all thoſe things that
concern thee only during this momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Life,</hi> in compariſon of
thoſe things that relate to thy future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. <hi>What ſhall it profit
a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> That there is a
<hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Chriſtian world is but too apparent: now you ſhall
find very learned and moderate <hi>Proteſtants</hi> acquitting the Church of

few now a days, except rank <hi>Fanatiques</hi> denying her to be a
<hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> Why then in the name of God ſhould there be a
<hi>Schiſm</hi> about matters of no vital importance? Enquire a little
further into matters. Read the <hi>Maſs</hi> it ſelf, and other Books of
Devotion written by <hi>Roman Catholiques;</hi> pray to God to inflame your
heart with the fire of <hi>Charity,</hi> and to beſtow upon you the Grace of
Humility, and contempt of your own <hi>private Spirit.</hi> Liſten now and
then to the <hi>inartificial</hi> Sermons of <hi>Roman Catholique
Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Fryars,</hi> and by the Grace of God you ſhall find
<hi>Popery</hi> another thing than you take it for. Remember that
<hi>Popery</hi> appears not with ſo ridiculous a <hi>Face</hi> to the eyes of
Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principles look as abſurdly to
the eyes of a Papiſt.</p>
            <p>The Intention of this Book is to preſent thee with a

us ſome of thoſe memorable paſſages that have occur'd to you in reading
that Hiſtory (which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay) he hath compiled with ſo

               <speaker>B.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In the firſt place, to entertain you with the Characters of
the firſt <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> of Reformation under
the famous King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and his Son <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and that
in the Doctors own words; which I remark to this end, that it may appear how
likely Perſons they were to have been ſent or raiſed up by God for the
Reformation of the <hi>World,</hi> and Reſtoration of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Piety.</p>
               <p>In the next place, to give you an Account of the Reformation it
ſelf (which began with King <hi>Henry</hi>'s divorcing of Queen
<hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> and Marriage with <hi>Ann Bolen</hi>) with ſome
Obſervations of my own, as I go along.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Take your own Method; and ſince you think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to
relate their Characters, I would fain know the Doctors O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of King

               <p>Take it it in his own words, <hi>viz.</hi> [I am not to defend
him, nor to leſſen his Faults. The vaſtneſs and irregularity of his
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence procured many heavy Exactions, and twice extorted a publique
Diſcharge of his Debts: His proud and impatient Spirit occaſioned many
cruel proceedings; The taking ſo many Lives only for denying his Supremacy,
particularly <hi>Fiſher</hi>'s and <hi>More</hi>'s, the one being extream
old, and the other one of the Glories of his Nation for Probity and Learning:
His extream Severity to all Cardinal <hi>Pools</hi> Family: His cruel uſing

Son; beſides his unexampled proceedings againſt ſome of his Wives.

being ſo conſpicuous and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47525:5"/>of his Proceedings
ſo unjuſtifiable, particularly that heinous Violation of the moſt
ſacred Rules of Juſtice and Government, in condemning men without bringing
them to make their Anſwers; moſt of our Writers have ſeparated the
concerns of this Church from his Reign; and imagining that all he did was
founded only on his Revenge upon the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for denying his
Divorce, have taken little care to examine how matters were tranſacted in his
time. <hi>Preface pag.</hi> 6.</p>

               <p>He thought the <hi>German</hi> Princes and Divines ſhould have
ſubmitted all things to his Judgment, and had ſuch an opinion of his own
Learning, and was ſo pufft up with the flattering Praiſes that he daily
heard, that he grew impatient of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and thought that his
Dictates ſhould paſs for Oracles. <hi>pag.</hi> 196. of his firſt vol. He
never hated nor ruined any body by halves, <hi>pag.</hi> 346. and <hi>p.</hi>
362. I do not deny that he is to be numbred among the ill Princes, yet I cannot
rank him with the worſt; He is rather to be reckoned among the great than the
good Princes. <hi>ibid.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; the Reader may obſerve <hi>Burnet</hi> ſtraining all
his Wit and Learning to find out Apologies and Excuſes for him and the reſt
of the Reformers. [If we conſider (ſaith he) the great things that were
done by him, we muſt acknowledge that there was a ſignal Providence of God
in raiſing up a King of his Temper for clearing the way to that
<hi>bleſſed Work</hi> that followed; and that could hardly have been done,
but by a man of his Humour. So that I may very fit'y apply to him the witty
<hi>ſimile</hi> of a Writer who compares <hi>Luther</hi> to a Poſtilion in
his waxed Boots and oiled Coat, laſhing his Horſes through thick and thin,
and beſpatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all about him. This Character befits King <hi>Henry</hi>
better, (ſaving the Reverence due to his Crown) who as the
<hi>Poſtilion</hi> of Reformation made way for it through a great deal of
mire and filth. <hi>Pref. pag.</hi> 6.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So that all he has to anſwer for <hi>Henry</hi> 8. amounts to
this, that others were as bad as he; this is a ſort of Apology which we call
<hi>Recrimination.</hi> Does that excuſe any mans Crimes?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No, the blemiſhing them (<hi>viz.</hi> the Popes) will not (I
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) excuſe our Reformers; therefore other things are to be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered for their Vindication, ſaith the Doctor, <hi>pag.</hi> 10.

               <p>What are thoſe other things?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why may not (ſaith he) an ill King do ſo good a work, as to
ſet a Reformation forward? Gods ways are a great deep, who has often ſhewed
his Power and Wiſdom in raiſing up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing inſtruments to do great
Services in the world; not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employing the beſt men in them.
<hi>Jehu</hi> did an acceptable Service to God in deſtroying the Idolatry of
<hi>Baal,</hi> though neither the way of doing it is to be imitated, being
groſſly inſincere; nor was the Reformation compleat, ſince the
Worſhip of the two Calves was ſtill kept up. And it is very like, his chief
deſign in it was to deſtroy all the party that favoured <hi>Ahabs</hi>
Family, yet the thing was good, and was rewarded by God. So, whatever this
Kings other Faults were, and how defective ſoever the Change he made was, and
upon what ill motives ſoever it may ſeem to have proceeded; yet the things
themſelves being good, we ought not to think the worſe of them becauſe of
the Inſtrument, or manner by which they were wrought, <hi>Pref. pag.</hi> 9.
Thus the Doctor thinks he has ſufficiently juſtified the Engliſh
Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Objections that may ariſe from the Impieties or
Vices of <hi>Henry</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47525:6"/>NOTE, <hi>Let the Reader obſerve here, how
the</hi> Doctor <hi>takes that for granted, which is the matter in queſtion;
namely, that the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Reformation was a good work; <hi>and that God
raiſed up</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 8. <hi>to ſet it forward. Nay, the Doctor knows, it
is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by the moſt conſiderable part of Chriſtendom,
both</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Latins, <hi>that God raiſed him up otherwiſe
than he is ſaid to have</hi> hardned Pharaoh's heart, <hi>when he only gave
him up to the Luſts and Cruelties of his own</hi> Heart. <hi>If the Doctors
meaning be, that</hi> Henry 8. <hi>was raiſed up by an impulſe or
inſpiration of Gods</hi> Spirit, <hi>to reform the</hi> Church, <hi>let him
make that appear by ſome other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than this further Character, and we
will believe him.</hi>

               <p>It will ſurpriſe ſome (ſaith the Doctor concerning his
firſt Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn) to ſee a Book of this bigneſs written of the Hiſtory of
our Reformation under the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ſince the true
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it, <hi>viz. Reformation,</hi> are to be reckoned from the Reign
of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>(mark the Antiquity of the Proteſtant Church)</hi>
in which the Articles of our Church and the Forms of our Worſhip were firſt
compiled and ſet forth by Authority <hi>(by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall appear
anon)</hi> and indeed in King <hi>Henrys</hi> time the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was rather
conceived than brought forth; and two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in the laſt eighteen
years of his Reign ſtruggling in the Womb, having now and then advantages on
either ſide, as the inconſtant humour of that King changed, and as his
Intereſts and often as his Paſſions ſwayed him: For being boiſterous
and impatient naturally, which was much heightned by his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Vanity, and high Conceit of his own Learning <hi>(ſtrange Evidence of a
Divine Miſſion)</hi> he was one of the moſt uncounſellable Perſons in

               <p>Indeed in the whole Progreſs of thoſe Changes (ſaith our
Hiſtorian) the King's deſign ſeemed to have been to terrifie the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and cudgel the <hi>Pope</hi> into a complyance with what he
deſired. For in his Heart he continued addicted to ſome of the moſt
extravagant opinions of that Church, ſuch as <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47525:7"/>
                  <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and the other Corruptions of the
<hi>Maſs;</hi> ſo that he was to his Lives end more Papiſt than
Proteſtant. <hi>page</hi> 7. <hi>Preface</hi> to 1 Vol.</p>
               <p>NOTE <hi>Reader. King</hi> Henry <hi>went to</hi> Maſs <hi>to
his dying day: So did all theſe three Kingdoms to the firſt or ſecond
year of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>VI. Here is yet no Evidence of God's having raiſed
him up by any Impulſe or Inſpiration of his Holy Spirit to Reform the
Church (if that were the Doctors meaning) only that God permitted him as he
does other Sinners to Act thoſe things for which they ſhall one day pay
dearly. That ſome Popes have been no Saints, I ſhall not diſpute it with
the Doctor: But let him ſhew, if he can, that any of the</hi> firſt
Reformers, Henry <hi>VIII.</hi> Ann Bolen, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Cromwell, Somerſet,
Northumberland, Ridly, <hi>&amp;c. were ſent or raiſed up by</hi> God
<hi>to reform the Faith or Manners of the Church, and there is an end of
the</hi> Controverſie. <hi>The Doctor inſtances in</hi> David, Solomon,
Jchu, <hi>who all had their failings; but how does that recommend or excuſe
our</hi> Reformers, <hi>who without any</hi> Comiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>or</hi>
Inſpiration <hi>from God preſumed to</hi> reform, <hi>that is to
ſay,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <hi>the Church wherein they were Baptized, and ſet up
another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own Fancies;</hi> who ſaid let us take to our ſelves
the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in Poſſeſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.12. <hi>Never
any</hi> Pope <hi>had the Wickedneſs to do ſuch things. And therefore to
affirm, that God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up ſuch Perſons to</hi> Plunder <hi>the Church
under pretence of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>it, what is it better or worſe then to

that every National Church is a compleat Body within it ſelf; ſo that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Authority and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Head

<hi>&amp;c. [If this be true, what needs any ſpecial Commiſſion or
Inſpiration from God to Reform the Church? Why may not every National Church
do it by their own Authority?]</hi> For ſaith the Doctor, a common
Concurrence of other Churches was a thing ſcarce to be expected, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Church muſt be in a very ill condition, if there could 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47525:7"/>be no endeavours for a Reformation till all the reſt were

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The deſign of this Catechiſm, is to ſhew by the Doctors
own Confeſſion, that the <hi>Engliſh Reformation</hi> was not the Act and
Deed of the National Church or <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> neither in
the days of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. nor of his Son <hi>Edward</hi> VI, nor of
Queen <hi>Eliſabeth;</hi> but impos'd upon the Nation by the Intereſt and
Power of a few Perſons for their own advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> the raiſing
their Fortunes out of Church Lands. And when I have done this, I ſhall leave
you to think what you pleaſe of Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s Modeſty, the
<hi>Preacher</hi> of St. <hi>Warbroughs;</hi> who in a late <hi>thing</hi>
which he calls an Anſwer to Dean <hi>Manby</hi>'s <hi>Conſiderations,</hi>
affirms very confidently, <hi>page</hi> 25. <hi>He</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Cranmer)
<hi>in all he did, had the unanimous Vote and Conſent of the major part of
the Convocation, the univerſal Submiſſion of the Clergy, and Approbation
of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And a little after, <hi>But if the Clergy in a National
Council, and the People in Obedience to them, or from their own Inclinations,
did comply in earneſt; what an idle Queſtion is it to ask,</hi> by what
Authority <hi>Cranmer</hi> condemned that Church from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his
Miſſion and Holy Orders? <hi>when ſhe concurred in all he did, and
approved, nay, made all the Alterations in her Liturgy, Sacraments and
Conſtitutions that were made,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

touching the Reformation it ſelf. I am ſatisfied that King <hi>Henry</hi>

               <p>This being (ſaith the Doctor) one of the moſt memorable
paſſages of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, I was at more then Ordinary pains
to learn all I could concerning it.—She was of a very cheerful temper,
which was not always limited within the bounds of exact Decency and
Diſcretion. She had rallied ſome of the King's Servants more than became
her; her Brother the Lord <hi>Rochford</hi> was her Friend as well as Brother.
But his ſpiteful Wife was jealous of him, and being a Woman of no ſort of
Vertue; ſhe carried many Stories to the King, or ſome about him, to
perſwade that there was a familiarity between the Queen and her Brother,
beyond what ſo near a Relation could juſtify. <hi>Henry Norris</hi> that
was Groom of the Stool. <hi>Weſton</hi> and <hi>Brereton</hi> that were of
the King's Privy-Chamber, and one <hi>Mark Smeton</hi> a Muſician, were all
obſerved to have much of her Favour. And their Zeal in ſerving her was
thought too warm and diligent to flow from a <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47525:9"/>leſs active
principle then <hi>Love.</hi> Many Circumſtances were brought to the King
which working upon his averſion to the Queen, together with his Affection to
Mrs <hi>Seymeur</hi> made him conclude her Guilty. Yet ſomewhat which
himſelf obſerved, or fancied at a Tilting at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> is
believed to have given the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to her Ruin. It is ſaid, that
he ſpied her let fall her Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to one of her Gallants to wipe his
Face being hot after a courſe. See the reſt <hi>page</hi> 197. 1

               <p>She confeſſed this odd paſſage between her ſelf, and
Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Norris.</hi> That ſhe once asked him, why he did not go on
with his Marriage? Who anſwered her, that he would yet tarry ſome time; to
which ſhe replyed, <hi>you look for Dead Mens Shoos;</hi> for, if ought come
to the King but good, you would look to have <hi>Me:</hi> He anſwered, if he
had any ſuch thought, he would his Head were cut off: Upon which ſhe
ſaid, ſhe could undo him if ſhe pleaſed, and thereupon ſhe fell out
with him, <hi>page</hi> 199. As for <hi>Mark Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who was then laid in
Irons, ſhe ſaid, he was never in her Chamber but when the King was laſt
at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> And then he came in to play on the Virginals: She
ſaid that ſhe never ſpoke to him after that, but on <hi>Saturday</hi>
before <hi>May</hi>-day, when ſhe ſaw him ſtanding in the Window; and
then ſhe asked him, Why he was ſo ſad? he ſaid it was no matter. She
anſwered, you may not look to have me ſpeak to you as if you were a
<hi>Noble Man,</hi> ſince you are an inferiour perſon. No, no Madam, ſaid
he, a Look ſufficeth me, <hi>ibid. page</hi> 199. She ſeemed more
apprehenſive of <hi>Weſlon</hi> then of any Body. For on
<hi>Whit-Sunday</hi> Morning laſt, he ſaid to her, that <hi>Norris</hi>
came more to her Chamber upon her account than for any body elſe that was
there. She had obſerved, that he loved a Kinſwoman of hers, and challenged
him for it, and for not loving his Wife. But he anſwered her, that there were
Women in the Houſe whom he loved better then them both; ſhe asked, who is
that? your ſelf ſaid he, upon which ſhe ſaid, ſhe deſied him

               <p>You may aſſure your ſelf he ſays nothing to her
diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but what the meer force of Truth extorts from him: The only
deſign of his Hiſtory being to magnify the Reformation, and all the Friends
thereof: He tells us <hi>page</hi> 202. She was indicted of High Treaſon, the
Crimes charged upon her being theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ſhe had
procured her Brother, and the other four to Lye with her, which they had done
often, and that ſhe ſaid to them that the King never had her Heart, and had
ſaid to every one of them by themſelves, that ſhe loved them better than
any Perſon whatſoever, which was to the ſlander of the Iſſue that was
Begotten between the King and Her, viz.</hi> the Lady <hi>Eliſabeth.</hi> It
was alſo added in the Indictment that ſhe and her Complices <hi>had
conſpired the Kings Death.</hi> But this it ſeems was only put in (ſaith
the Doctor) to ſwell the Charge. When the Indictment was read ſhe held up
her hand and pleaded not <hi>Guilty,</hi> and ſo did her Brother, and did
Anſwer the Evidence that was brought in againſt her diſcreetly: One thing
is remarkable, that <hi>Mark Smeton,</hi> who was the only Perſon that
confeſſed any thing, was never confronted with the Queen, nor was kept to
be an Evidence againſt her, having received his Sentence three days before,
and ſo could be no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47525:10"/>in Law. But perhaps though
he was wrought on to <hi>Confeſs,</hi> yet they did not think he had
Confidence enough to aver it to the Queens Face, therefore the Evidence they
brought, as <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſays, was the Oath of a Woman that was Dead.
Yet this, or rather the Terror of offending the King, ſo wrought on the
Lords, that they found her and her Brother Guilty, <hi>page</hi> 202. and
Judgment was given that ſhe ſhould be <hi>Burnt.</hi>

               <p>Now ſhe lying under ſo terrible a Sentence, it is moſt

was wrought on by the aſſurances of mitigating that cruel part of her
Judgment, of being <hi>Burnt,</hi> into the milder part of the Sentence of
<hi>having her Head cut off.</hi> So that ſhe <hi>confeſſed</hi> a
<hi>Precontract</hi> (with the Lord <hi>Peircy,</hi>) and on the 17th of
<hi>May</hi> was brought to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and in Court, the afflicted
Archbiſhop <hi>(Crammer)</hi> ſitting Judge, ſome Perſons of Quality
being preſent, ſhe <hi>confeſſed</hi> ſome juſt and lawful
Impediments, by which it was Evident that her Marriage with the King was not
valid, upon which Confeſſion her Marriage between the King and Her was
judged to have been null and void. The Record of the Sentence is burnt (ſays
the Doctor) but theſe particulars are repeated in the Act that paſſed the

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on this matter. <hi>viz.</hi> The two Sentences that were paſt
upon the Queen, the one of Attainder for <hi>Adultery,</hi> the other of 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47525:11"/>
                  <hi>Divorce</hi> becauſe of a Precontract, did ſo
Contradict one another, that it was apparent one, if not both of them muſt be
unjuſt: For if the Marriage between the King and Her was null from the
beginning, then ſince ſhe was not the Kings wedded Wife, there could be no
<hi>Adultery.</hi> And her Marriage with the King was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a true Marriage
or not; if it was true, then the annulling of it was unjuſt. And if it was no
true Marriage, then the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder</hi> was unjuſt; for there could be no
breach of that Faith which was never given. <hi>p.</hi> 203.</p>
               <p>NOTE <hi>But it appears by her own Confeſſion, that ſhe
had given her Faith both to the King and the Lord</hi> Peircy. <hi>Only the
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in his Margine there calls it an extorted Confeſſion.</hi> Heylin

The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable attractions of which young Lady <hi>(Ann Bolen)</hi> had drawn
the King ſo faſt unto her, that in ſhort time he gave her an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Sovereignty over all his Thoughts. But ſo long he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his Affections
from her, that a great League and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was contracted betwixt her and
the young Lord <hi>Peircy,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Henry</hi> Lord
<hi>Peircy,</hi> who being brought up in the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Service, had
many opportunities of confirming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with her. <hi>See the

Innocency. But</hi> Heylin <hi>gives this account of it,</hi> pag. 264.
<hi>which I will not conceal from the Reader; viz.</hi> From none of the
Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47525:11"/>they (namely the Kings Commiſſioners)
were able to get any thing by all their Arts, which might give any ground for
her Conviction, but that <hi>Mark Smeton</hi> had been wrought on to make
ſome Confeſſion of himſelf to her Diſhonour, out of a vain hope to
ſave his own Life by the loſs of hers. Concerning which, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
thus writes to the King, after the Priſoners had been tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly examined in
the <hi>Tower</hi> by the Lords of the Council. <hi>Many things</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>have been objected, but nothing confeſſed, only ſome
Circumſtances have been acknowledged by</hi> Mark Smeton. It appears alſo
by a Letter of Sir <hi>William Kingſtons</hi> (ſays <hi>Heylin</hi>) that
he had much communication with her when ſhe was his Priſoner; in which her
Language ſeemed to be broken btwixt Tears and Laughter, out of which nothing
could be gathered, but that ſhe exclaimed againſt <hi>Norris,</hi> as if he
had accuſed her. It was further ſignified in that Letter, that ſhe named
ſome others who had obſequiouſly applied themſelves to her Love &amp;
Service, acknowledging ſuch paſſages, <hi>(mark this)</hi> though not
ſufficient to condemn her, as ſhewed ſhe had made uſe of the utmoſt
liberty which could be honeſtly allowed her.—There was no Evidence
againſt her, but the Confeſſion of <hi>Smeton,</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of
the Lady <hi>Rochfort;</hi> of which the one was fooled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that
Confeſſion by the hope of Life, which notwithſtanding was not pardoned,
and the other moſt deſervedly loſt her Head within few years after.
<hi>Heylin Hiſt; Reform. pag.</hi> 264, 265. <hi>I have added this favourable
account out of</hi> Heylin, <hi>to let the Reader ſee the miſtake of that
Character which Doctor</hi> Burnet <hi>gives of him in the Preface to his
firſt volum.</hi> viz. He being wrought on by moſt violent prejudices
againſt ſome that were concerned in that time, delivers many things in
ſuch a manner, and ſo ſtrangely, that one would think he had been
ſecretly ſet on by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome, &amp;c. If ever</hi>
Heylin <hi>were ſet on to ſerve the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>it muſt be
ſurely in the</hi> Hiſtory of Ann Bolen, <hi>upon which there is ſo much
depending in reference to the Birth and Title of Queen</hi> Eliſabeth.
<hi>But the Reader may find him relating her whole Story ſo favourably,</hi>

Burnet <hi>himſelf could not ſay more: yet whoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares both Writers,

confeſs the Adultery, ſays <hi>Heylin,</hi> to which he made this generous
Anſwer, that in his Conſcience he thought her guiltleſs of the Crimes
objected againſt her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Lord <hi>Peircy</hi> took the
Sacrament, wiſhing that the ſame might be his Damnation, if ever there were
any Contract or Promiſe of Marriage betwixt her and him. <hi>Heylin p.</hi>

               <p>The Doctor tells you, the Popiſh Party ſaid, the Juſtice
of God was viſible, that ſhe who had ſupplanted Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi>
met with the like meaſure (<hi>he means by</hi> Jane Seymour.) Some took
notice of her faint juſtifying her ſelf on the Scaffold, as if her
Conſcience had then prevailed ſo far, that ſhe could no longer deny a
thing for which ſhe was ſo ſoon to Anſwer at another Tribunal. But
others thought her care of her Daughter made her ſpeak ſo tenderly; for
ſhe had obſerved that Queen <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> obſtinacy had drawn the
King's Indignation on Lady <hi>Mary.</hi> Therefore ſhe ſpoke in a ſtile,
(ſays the Doctor) that could give the King no juſt offence, <hi>page</hi>
206. He proceeds; Some have ſince that time concluded it a great Evidence of
her <hi>Guilt;</hi> that <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47525:13"/>during her Daughters (Queen
<hi>Eliſabeths</hi>) long and glorious Reign, there was no full nor compleat
Vindication of her publiſht. For the Writers of that time thought it enough
to ſpeak honorably of her, and in general to call her <hi>Innecent;</hi> but
none of them ever at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempted a clear diſcuſſion of the particulars
laid to her Charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This had been much to her Daughters Honour (ſaith
Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi>) and therefore ſince it was not done, others concluded,
it could not be done; and that their knowledge of her Guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained their
Pens. But others do not at all allow of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and think rather, that
it was the great Wiſdom of that time not to ſuffer ſuch things to be
called in queſtion:—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was prudently done of that Queen
<hi>(Eliſabeth)</hi> and her great Miniſters, not to ſuffer any
Vindication or Apology to be written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Indiſcretions
(ſaith the Doctor) could not be denied. <hi>p.</hi> 207. 1. <hi>vel. that is,

ſhe had ſuch different Intereſts that they could not both ſubſiſt
together, reſolved upon that courſe which Nature and Self-preſervation
ſeemed to dictate to her: but finding that the Pope was too well intrenched
to be diſlodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſudden, it was adviſed by <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
(made Maſter of the <hi>Rolls</hi> upon her Commendation) to begin with
taking in the Outworks firſt (<hi>meaning the leſſer Monaſteries to the

beat him out of his Trenches. <hi>p.</hi> 262. <hi>Thoſe Houſes were
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by Act of Parliament,</hi> anno 1535. to the paſſing whereof
the Biſhops and <hi>Mitred</hi> Abbots, which made the prevalent part of the

it were out of Puſillanimity, as not daring to appear in behalf of their
Brethren, or out of a weak hope <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47525:14"/>that the <hi>Rapacity</hi>
of the Queen <hi>(mark this)</hi> and her Miniſters would proceed no further,
it is hard to ſay. <hi>Heylin, page</hi> 263. Certain it is (ſays he) that
by their improvident aſſenting to the preſent Grant, they made a Rod for
their own Backs (as the ſaying is) with which they were ſufficiently
ſcourged within ſew years after, though the new Queen <hi>(obſerve)</hi>
for whoſe ſake <hi>Cromwell</hi> had contrived the Plot, did not live to

to put an end unto the Calamities of the Vertuous, but unfortunate Queen
<hi>(Katherine,)</hi> into whoſe Bed ſhe had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The News whereof
ſhe entertained with ſuch Contentment that ſhe cauſed her ſelf to be
Apparrell'd in lighter colours than was agreeable to the ſeaſon, or the
ſad occaſion: Whereas, if ſhe had rightly underſtood her own Condition,
ſhe could not but have known that the long Life of <hi>Katherine</hi> was to

kept her Women well employed about her; as appeared when the two

him, and made a Speech. She ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">'She was a poor Woman and a Stranger in his
Dominions, where ſhe could neither expect good Council, nor indifferent
Judges. She had been long his Wife, and deſired to know wherein ſhe had
offended him: That ſhe had been his Wife twenty years and more, and had born
him ſeveral Children, and had ever ſtudied to pleaſe him, and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he had found her a true Maid, about which ſhe appealed to his

Honour, found him to be <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47525:16"/>the moſt corrupt Traitor and
Deceiver of the King and the Crown, that had ever been known in his whole
Reign. That he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral Bribes, and for them granted Licenſes
to carry Mony, Corn, Horſes, and other things out of the Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the King's <hi>Proclamations;</hi> that he being alſo an Heretick had
diſperſed many Erroneous Books among the King's Subjects, particularly
ſome that were contrary to the belief of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and when
ſome had informed him of this, and had ſhewed him theſe Hereſies in
Books printed in <hi>England;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>they were good, and that he
found no fault in them:</hi> and ſaid, <hi>it was as lawful for every
Chriſtian Man to be a Miniſter of the Sacrament, as a Prieſt.</hi> And
whereas the King had conſtituted him <hi>Vice Gerent</hi> for the ſpiritual
affairs of the Church, he had under the Seal of that Office Licenſed many
that were ſuſpected of Hereſie to Preach over the Kingdom. And had both
by Word and Writing ſuggeſted to ſeveral <hi>Sheriffs</hi> that it was
the King's pleaſure they ſhould diſcharge many Priſoners, of whom
ſome were indicted, others apprehended for <hi>Hereſie.</hi> And when many
particular Complaints were brought to him of deteſtable Hereſies with the
names of the Offenders, he not onely defended the <hi>Hereticks</hi> but
ſeverely checkt the Informers. And vexed ſome of them by Impriſonment,
and otherways. And he having entertained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the King's Subjects about
himſelf, whom he had infected with Hereſie, and imagining he was by force
able to defend his Treaſons and Hereſies, on the laſt of <hi>March</hi>
in the 30th year of the King's Reign, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> when ſome of them complained to him of the new Preachers,
ſuch as <hi>Barnes,</hi> and others; he ſaid <hi>their Preaching was
good;</hi> and ſaid alſo among other things, <hi>that if the King would
turn from it, yet he would not turn. And if the King did turn and all his
People with him, he would fight in the field in his own Perſon with his Sword
in his Hand againſt him and all others.</hi> And then he pulled out his
Dagger, and held it up and ſaid, <hi>or elſe this Dagger thruſt Me to the
Heart, if I would not dye in that quarrel againſt them all: And I truſt if
I live one year or two, it ſhall not be in the King's <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47525:16"/>power to reſiſt, or let it if he would.</hi> And Swearing a great
Oath, ſaid, <hi>I would do ſo Indeed.</hi> He had alſo by Oppreſſion
and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery made a great Eſtate to himſelf, and extorted much Money from
the King's Subjects, and being greatly enriched had treated the Nobility with
much Contempt. For all which Treaſons and Hereſies he was attainted to
ſuffer the pains of Death as ſhould pleaſe the King, and to forfeit all
his Eſtate and Goods to the King's uſe. Theſe are the Words of the
<hi>Act. Burnet, page</hi> 278. 279.</p>

               <p>Moſt of theſe things relate to Orders and Directions he had
given, for which it is very probable he had the King's Warrant. And for the
matter of Hereſie, it has appeared how far the King had proceeded towards a
Reformation, ſo that what he did that way, was moſt likely done by the
King's Orders. But the King now falling from theſe things, it was thought
they intended to ſtifle him by ſuch an <hi>Attainder,</hi> that he might
not diſcover the ſecret Orders or Directions given him for his own
juſtification; <hi>page</hi> 279.</p>

How far the King had proceeded towards a Reformation was then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the

what he ſpoke at his Death he leſt it much doubted of what Religion he
dyed: But it is certain he was a <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſays <hi>Burnet, page</hi>

ſeemed to make it doubtful; but that was then uſed in <hi>England</hi> in
its true Sence, in oppoſition to the Novelties of the See of <hi>Rome,
page</hi> 285. <hi>ibid.</hi> So that his Profeſſion of the <hi>Catholick

outlive this ruin, (<hi>he means ſome few Houſes which K</hi> Henry <hi>had

Deprivation, Sequeſtration of your Fruits, or ſuch other Coercion as to the
Kings Highneſs or his <hi>Vice-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> for the time being ſhall ſeem
convenient. This was in the year 1538.</p>
               <p>One of thoſe Injunctions was this, <hi>viz.</hi> You ſhall
ſuffer from henceforth no Candles, Tapers, or Images of Wax to be ſet
before any Image or Picture, but only the Light that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly goeth a croſs
the Church by the Rood Loft, the Light before the Sacrament of the Altar, and
the Light about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; which for the adorning of the Church and Divine
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ye ſhall ſuffer to remain: ſtill admoniſhing your
Pariſhioners that <hi>Images</hi> ſerve for none other purpoſe, but as
the <hi>Bocks</hi> of unlearned men, that <hi>ken</hi> no Letters, whereby they
might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe admoniſhed of the Lives and Converſation of them that
the ſaid Images do repreſent. <hi>Alſo</hi> that you ſhall expreſsly
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, ſtir and exhort every perſon to read the Bible, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
them nevertheleſs to avoid all Contention, Altercation therein, and to uſe
an honeſt Sobriety in the inquiſition of <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47525:18"/>the true
ſenſe of the ſame, and refer the Explication of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places to men
of higher Judgment in Scripture.</p>
               <p>NOTE. <hi>Such Admonitions were to no purpoſe; the Bible
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once permitted into the rude hands of the Multitude. For what (ſay
they) does he allow us to read the Scripture, and then debar us the uſe of
our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings! Has not every man a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion to read

the ſleeve of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another of his Injunctions was, that you ſhall in

Articles of our Faith, and the <hi>Pater noſter</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>

ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, that every Chriſtian ought to know the ſame
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receive the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, and to learn the
ſame more perfectly by the next year following. So you ſhall declare unto
them, that you look for other Injunctions <hi>(mark this)</hi> from the Kings

<hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was then Negotiating his buſineſs among the learned

<hi>Cranmer,</hi> deſigned to raiſe him to that <hi>Dignity;</hi> and gave
him notice of it, that he might make haſte and come home to enjoy that reward
which the King had appointed for him. But <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> having received

coming upon him; and therefore he returned very ſlowly to <hi>England;</hi>
hoping that the Kings thoughts cooling, ſome other Perſon might ſtep in
between him and a <hi>Dignity,</hi> of which having a juſt and primitive
Senſe, he did look on it with Fear and Apprehenſion rather than Joy and
Deſire: This was ſo far from ſetting him back, that the King was thereby
confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his high Opinion of him; and neither the delays of his Journey,
nor his Intreaties to be delivered from a Burden which his humility made him
imagine himſelf unable to bear, could divert the King (<hi>and good reaſon

               <p>Firſt as to his Religion, I will tell you my own opinion: A
<hi>Papiſt</hi> he could not be at that time, becauſe he denied the Popes
<hi>Supremacy</hi> and other Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of the
preſent Church of <hi>England</hi> he could not be, becauſe he went to
<hi>Maſs</hi> then and 14 years after: ſo that he muſt be of King
<hi>Henry</hi>'s Church, or of none at all. In the year 1538. he was (ſays
<hi>Burnet</hi>) of <hi>Luthers</hi> Opinion, which he had drunk in from his
Friend <hi>Oſiander. pag.</hi> 252. 1. <hi>vol.</hi> And ſate upon the
Tryal and Condemnation of <hi>John Lambert,</hi> one of the new Preachers, for
denying the Corporal Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament. After the Death
of K. <hi>Henry</hi> (of whom he ſtood in aw) he tackt about with the next
wind of Doctrine, which was <hi>Zuinglianiſm;</hi> and joyning with King
<hi>Edwards</hi> privy Counſellors, he reformed, that is, ſubverted the
eſtabliſhed Religion of the Nation. Yet in the firſt year of King
<hi>Edward, Heylin</hi> tells you <pb n="32" facs="tcp:47525:22"/>that he with eight other
Biſhops all in their rich <hi>Mitres</hi> and other <hi>Pontificals</hi>
ſang a <hi>Maſs</hi> of <hi>Requiem,</hi> for the Soul of <hi>Francis</hi>
the French King then lately deceaſed, <hi>Hiſtory Reform. page</hi> 40.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he with the reſt of the Privy-Council had a good
while before ſent out their <hi>Injunctions</hi> and
<hi>Commiſſioners</hi> into all parts of the Nation, and Preachers to
attend them; which <hi>Preachers</hi> were particularly inſtructed to
diſſwade the people from <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> from
<hi>Diriges</hi> and <hi>Maſſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heylin, p.</hi> 34. yet

               <p>Yes, Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> ſays, he had ſome <hi>particular
Conceits</hi> of his own, or ſingular Opinions which he delivered with all

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You ſhall hear them together, with the excuſe which the
Doctor makes for him. Firſt, <hi>That Biſhops and Prieſts were at one,
time, and were not two things, but one Office in the beginning of Chriſts
Religion.</hi> In which Opinion all the Biſhops and Clergy of
<hi>England,</hi> except two Biſhops and two Doctors were againſt him.
<hi>Burnet,</hi> Collection Records, <hi>page</hi> 223.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Biſhop may make a Prieſt, and ſo may Princes
and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours alſo; and that by the Authority of God committed to them, and
the <hi>People</hi> by their <hi>Election:</hi> For as we read that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have done it, ſo Chriſtian Emperors and Princes uſually have done it; and
the People, before Chriſtian Princes were, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly did Elect their
Biſhops and Prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all the reſt of the Biſhops and Clergy, except the
Biſhop of Saint</hi> Davids, <hi>and two or three Doctors, ſaid
poſitively that they found no example either in Scripture, or the ancient
Doctors, that any Man beſide a Biſhop hath Authority to make
Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the New Teſtament he that is appointed to be a
Biſhop, or a Prieſt needeth no Conſecration by the Scripture; for
Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Appointing thereunto is ſufficient. <hi>This all the Biſhops 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47525:23"/>contradicted</hi> (<hi>except Saint</hi> Davids); ſaying,
that the Apoſtles made Prieſts by impoſition of Hands, with Faſting and
Prayer; and Dr. <hi>Redmayn</hi> ſaid, the Office of Prieſthood is too
dangerous a thing to be undertaken <hi>(to be ſet upon are his words)</hi>
when one is but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only; therefore for the Confirmation of their Faith
who take in hand ſuch a Charge, and for the obtaining of further Grace
requiſite to the ſame, Conſecration was ordained by the holy Ghoſt, and
hath been always uſed from the beginning, <hi>page</hi> 230.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To this Queſtion, whether a Chriſtian Prince having
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered certain Dominions of Infidels, and having none about him but
Lay-men, He and They may not by the Law of God Preach and Teach God's Word, and
alſo make and conſtitute Prieſts? <hi>Cranmer</hi> Anſwers
poſitively; <hi>It is not againſt God's Law, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they ought
indeed ſo to do: and there be Hiſtories that witneſs that ſome
Chriſtian Princes, and other Lay men unconſecrate have done the
ſame.</hi> Reader, <hi>The Engliſh Biſhops perhaps were not aware of his
deſign in propoſing this and ſuch like Queſtions; which was to</hi>
nooze <hi>them into a Conceſſion under their Hands, that the Prince might
Preach himſelf, and Authorize others to preach</hi> Reformation <hi>in caſe
of neceſſity; that is, If his Clergy and Biſhops would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as</hi> Cranmer <hi>knew they would not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To this Queſtion, Whether a Man is bound by the
Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Scripture, <hi>Quorum remiſeritis peccata, remiſſa
ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. to Confeſs his ſecret deadly Sins to a Prieſt? He
anſwers point blank, <hi>that no Man is bound.</hi> All the Biſhops and
Clergy (three or four excepted) honeſtly affirming, that by Authority of
thoſe words, Chriſtians are bound to Confeſs their ſecret as well as
open Sins: That Prieſts are bound to give Abſolution, but no Prieſt can
Abſolve from that Sin which he knows not. Doctor <hi>Treſham</hi>
anſwered, Such Confeſſion is a thing moſt Conſonant to the Law of
God: and that it is a wiſe point, and a wholſome thing ſo to do. And God
(ſaid he) provoketh and allureth us thereunto by giving active Power to
Prieſts to Abſolve in theſe words. <hi>Whoſoever Sins ye remit, they
are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. It is alſo a ſafer way for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to
Confeſs, if we may have a <hi>Prieſt, page</hi> 238. <hi>Collections.</hi> 
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47525:24"/>Doctor <hi>Edgeworth</hi> anſwered worthily, that to
obtain Remiſſion of Sin and Recover the Grace of God, a Man is bound by the
Law of Nature to take the ſurer way. And becauſe (ſaid he) we are bound
to Love God above all things, we ought by the ſame Bond to ſeek the beſt
and ſureſt Remedy for the Recovery of his Grace. Contrition is one way, but
becauſe a Man cannot be well aſſured, whether his Contrition, Attrition
or Diſpleaſure for his Sins be ſufficient to ſatisfie Almighty God, or
worthy to obtain his Grace; therefore it is neceſſary to take that way that
will not fail, and by which thou mayeſt be ſure; and that is
<hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> by the Prieſt, which by Chriſt's promiſe will not
deceive thee, ſo that thou put no obſtacle or bar in the way; that is, if
thou do not then actually Sin inwardly or outwardly, but intend to receive what
the Church intends to give Thee by that Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the Prieſt can
give thee no Abſolution from that Sin which he knows not, therefore thou art
bound to confeſs thy Sin. Thus Doctor <hi>Edgeworth, page</hi> 237.

honeſty or piety of this Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Leighton</hi> anſwered, I think ſuch only as have
not the knowledge of the Scripture, be bound to confeſs their ſecret deadly
Sins unto a Prieſt. Howbeit no Man ought to deſpiſe ſuch <hi>Auricular
Confeſſion;</hi> for I ſuppoſe it to be a Tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical,
neceſſary for the unlearned Multitude. <hi>Thus he</hi> page 238.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. To this Queſtion, Whether only Biſhops and
Prieſts may Excommunicate by God's Law; he anſwers, a Biſhop or a
Prieſt by the Scripture is neither commanded nor forbidden to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate;
but where the Laws of any Country giveth him Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Excommunicate, there
they ought to uſe the ſame in ſuch Crimes as the Laws have ſuch
Authority in, and where the Laws of the Region forbiddeth them, there they have
no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at all. And they that be no Prieſts may alſo Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
if the Law allow thereunto.</p>
               <p>NOTE. <hi>That in Queen,</hi> Mary<hi>'s days, Catholick
Religion being reſtored by Law,</hi> Cranmer <hi>had by his own
Confeſſion no Power of the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47525:24"/>Keys. Nay, every Conſtable
might Excommunicate as well as he, if the Law gave power.</hi> Theſe were

<q rend="inline">'<hi>Thom. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarienſ.</hi> this is my

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Very oddly, as a Man would think, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſeems that
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he changed his Opinion, for he ſubſcribed the Book that was
ſoon after ſet out, which is directly contrary to theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<hi>that is to ſay, in the year</hi> 1540. <hi>he ſubſcribed to a Book
for ſeven Sacraments, for Tranſubſtantiation, for the profitable uſe of
Images to put us in mind of the great Bleſſings we have received by our
Saviour; for deſiring the Prayers of Saints as Interceſſors, being the
Doctrine of the Catholick Church. For the uſe of the Hymn cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ave
Maria,</hi> in Commemoration of Chriſts Incarnation and to ſet forth the
Praiſes of the bleſſed Virgin. <hi>Of all which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars he believed
not a ſyllable; though he ſubſcribed with the reſt of the Biſhops.
Nay,</hi> Burnet <hi>tells you plainly, page</hi> 289. that he was then for
reducing the ſeven Sacraments to two, but the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party was prevalent
at that time. So the old number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was agreed to <hi>anno</hi> 1540.
<hi>that is, the major vote of Biſhops carried it againſt him, and he
durſt not but ſubſcribe for fear of King</hi> Henry. <hi>In the year</hi>
1536, <hi>which was but four years before, he gave his ſubſcription to a
Book for three Sacraments onely; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was declared the neceſſity
of</hi> Auricular Confeſſion; <hi>and that it was good to pray unto the
Saints to pray for and with us: Of which he believed not a tittle. See</hi>
Burnet, page 217. <hi>ſo that by what he ſubſcribed it can never be
gathered that he quitted thoſe</hi> ſtrange Opinions.</p>

               <p>Yes, the Popiſh Party have but too great advantages againſt

and Errors of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and all other Teachings
which be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſound and true Doctrine. And I believe moſt
conſtantly in my heart, and with my mouth I confeſs one holy and
Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church viſible, withotu the which there is no Salvation. And
therefore I acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Supream Head on
Earth; whom I knowledge to be the higheſt Biſhop and Pope, and Chriſts
Vicar, unto whom all Chriſtian people ought to be Subject.</p>
               <p>And as concerning the Sacraments, I believe and worſhip in the
Sacrament of the Altar the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, being contained
moſt truly under the forms of Bread and Wine, the Bread, through the mighty
Power of God, being turned into the Body of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and
the Wine into his Blood. And in the other ſix Sacraments alſo, like as in
this, I believe and hold as the Univerſal Church holdeth, and the Church of

               <p>Furthermore, I believe that there is a place of
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> where Souls departed be puniſhed for a time, for whom the
Church doth godly and wholſomly pray, like as it doth honour Saints, and make
prayers to them.</p>
               <p>Finally, in all things I profeſs, that I do not otherwiſe
believe than the Catholique Church and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth

me.</p>
               <p>And all ſuch as have been deceived either by mine Example or
Doctrine, I require them by the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that they
will return to the Unity of the Church, and the Supream Head thereof. So I
ſubmit my ſelf unto the moſt excellent Majeſties of <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Mary</hi> King and Queen of this Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</hi> and to

               <p>Yes, when he ſaw no hopes of his Pardon; and being brought to

               <p>The Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> was wont to ſay unto
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> My Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> you are moſt happy of all
men; for you may do and ſpeak what you liſt; and ſay what all men can
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47525:26"/>you, the King will never believe one word to
your detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I am ſure, I take more pains than all the <hi>Council</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and ſpend more largely on the Kings Affairs, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the
Seas as on this ſide; yea, I aſſure you, for very <hi>Spyes</hi> in
foreign Realms, at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere, it coſts me above a
Thouſand Marks a year; and do what I can to bring matters to light for the
commodity of the King and the Realm, I am every day chidden, and many falſe
Tales now and then believed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; and therefore you are moſt happy,
for in no point can you be diſcredited with the King. The Archbiſhop

                  <hi>Fox</hi> tells you further, how certain of the Council
declared plainly to the King about that time, that the Realm was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Hereſies &amp; Heretiques, that it was dangerous for His Highneſs
further to permit it; leſt peradventure by long ſuffering, ſuch
Contention ſhould ariſe, and enſue in the Realm amongſt his Subjects,
that thereby might ſpring horrible Rebellions and Uproars, like as in ſome
parts of <hi>Germany</hi> it happened not long ago; the Enormity whereof they
could not impute to any ſo much as to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,
p.</hi> 641, 642.</p>
               <p>But the King, ſays <hi>Fox,</hi> moſt entirely loved him,
and always ſtood in his defence whoſoever ſpake againſt him; and once
ſaid to ſome Lords of his Council, I proteſt (ſolemnly laying his hand
upon his breaſt) by the Faith which I ow to God, I take this man, my Lord of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> to be of all other a moſt ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subject to us, and

               <p>In Saint <hi>Mary</hi>'s Church at <hi>Oxford,</hi> on the 12th
of <hi>March,</hi> anno 1556. Doctor <hi>Brooks</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> charged him as followeth. My Lord, at this preſent we
are ſent by Commiſſion partly from the Popes Holyneſs, partly from the
King and Queens moſt excellent Majeſties, not to your utter diſcomfort,
but to your comfort, if you will your ſelf; not to judge you, but to put you
in Remembrance of what you have been. Neither come we to Diſpute with you,
but to Examine you in certain matters, which being done, to make Relation
thereof to him that hath power to judge you. And firſt, as Charity doth move
us, I think good to exhort you by the words of Saint <hi>John. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from
whence you are fallen, and do your firſt works.</hi> You have fallen from the
univerſal Church of Chriſt, from the very true and received Faith of all
Chriſtendom, and that by open <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:</hi> You have fallen from your
promiſe to God, from your Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Allegiance, and that by open
Preaching, by Marriage and Adultery: You have fallen from your Sovereign Prince
and Queen by open Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and although it may be
conjectured that in all your time ye were not upright in the Honour and Faith
of Chriſt; but rather ſet up of purpoſe as a fit inſtrument <hi>(note
this)</hi> whereby the Church might be ſpoiled and brought into ruin; yet it
may appear by many your doings otherwiſe, and I for my part, as it behoveth
each one of us, ſhall think the beſt. For who was thought to have more
Conſcience of obſerving the Order of the Church? More earneſt in the
defence of the real preſence of Chriſt's Body and Blood in the Sacrament of
the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar than yee were? Then all things proſpered with you, your Prince
favoured you; your Candleſtick was ſet up in the higheſt place of the
Church, and the light of your Candle was over all <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47525:27"/>the
Church. But after ye began to fall by Schiſm, and would ſtoutly uphold the
unlawful requeſts of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII then began you to fancy
unlawful liberty. When yee had exiled a good Conſcience, when you had
forſaken God, God forſook you, and gave you over to your own will, and
ſuffered you to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Schiſm and Hereſie, and from that to Perjury,
and from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Treaſon, and ſo in concluſion, into the full
Indignation of our Sovereign Prince, which you may think a juſt puniſhment
of God for your other abominable Opinions.</p>
               <p>But here peradventure you will ſay to me; what Sir, my fall is
not ſo great as you make it. I have not yet fallen from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church;</hi> for that is not the Catholick Church that the Pope is Head of,
there is another Church. To which I anſwer, you are as ſure of that as the
<hi>Donatiſts</hi> were; for they ſaid, they had the true Church; and that
true Chriſtians remained only in <hi>Africa,</hi> where only their Seditious
<hi>Sect</hi> was preached. And as you think, ſo thought <hi>Novatus,</hi>
that all who did acknowledge the Supremacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> were out of the
Church of Chriſt. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> defending <hi>Cornelius</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi> Lib 2. Epiſt. 6.
ſaith, <hi>Eccleſia una eſt, quae cum ſit una, intus &amp; foris
eſſe non poteſt.</hi> So that if <hi>Novatus</hi> was in the true Church,
then was not <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who by lawful Succeſſion ſucceeded Pope
<hi>Fabian.</hi> Here Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> intends by the whole proceſs to
prove, and concludeth thereupon, that the true Church was only <hi>Rome.</hi>
But you will ſay perhaps, that you fell not by <hi>Hereſie;</hi> ſo
ſaid the <hi>Arrians</hi> alledging <hi>Scripture</hi> for themſelves, and
going about to perſwade their <hi>Hereſie</hi> by Scripture.</p>
               <p>So did the <hi>Marcions</hi> appeal to Scripture, to Scripture
not truly interpreted, but wreſted according to their own Fancies. And the
Church replyeth againſt them <hi>qui eſtis vos?</hi> from whence came you?
What right have you to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are the <hi>Churches</hi>
Inheritance? Alſo yee will deny that yee have fallen by Apoſtacy and
breaking your Vow; and ſo <hi>Vigilantius</hi> ſaid, and would admit none
to his <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> but ſuch as had their Wives <hi>bagg'd</hi> with
Children. What then? ſhall we ſay that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> fell 
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47525:28"/>not, that <hi>Donatus</hi> and <hi>Novatus</hi> were no
Sciſmaticks, becauſe they pretended Scripture in their own Defence? then
let every Man believe as he liſts, and quote Scripture for it: So that your
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal will not avail you. Therefore I tell you, remember from whence you are
fallen. <hi>Age paenitentiam &amp; prima opera fac.</hi> If yee remember how
many yee have brought by abominable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie into the way of Perdition, I
doubt not but very Conſcience would move you, as well for them as for your
ſelf to return again; <hi>qui convertere fecerit peccatorem ab errore vitae
ſuae ſalvam faciet animam ſuam a Morte &amp; operiet multitudinem
peccatorum ſuorum.</hi> He that ſhall convert a Sinner from his
Wickedneſs ſhall ſave his Soul from Death, and ſhall cover a multitude
of Sins: So on the contrary, it muſt needs be true, he that perverteth a
Soul, and teacheth him the way of Perdition muſt needs be Damn'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſeemed to fear that danger; provided for
it in his Life time, and did not only repent but recant; and not ſo much for
himſelf as for them whom he had infected by his abominable Hereſies. For as
he lay on his Death-bed upon the day of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> he demanded of them
that were preſent, is this the day of <hi>Epiphany</hi> and appearing of our
<hi>Lord?</hi> They anſwered him Yes; then (ſaid he) this day ſhall the
Lord appear to me either to my comfort or diſcomfort. This Remorſe argues,
that he ſeared the danger of them whom he had ſeduced from the Faith of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let this move you even at the laſt point; as your Caſe is
not unlike to <hi>Berengarius,</hi> ſo let your Repentance be like his,
unleſs you will <hi>according to the hardneſs of your Heart treaſure up
wrath againſt the day of Wrath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, what is it then, perhaps ſhame to unſay what you have
ſaid may hinder your return. But Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought it no ſhame to repent and agree with the
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church. You will ſay perhaps, your Conſcience will not
ſuffer you. But what Conſcience is it that would ſeparate you from all
the reſt of the Chriſtian World? to a liberty which hath no ground in the
Holy Scriptures. If you judge this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47525:28"/>to be good,
then you judge all Chriſtendom to do evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your ſelf.</p>
               <p>O what a preſumptuous Opinion in this! whereupon to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Church of Chriſt: what is your colour or pretence for this? the Abuſes
of the Church? as though in your Church there were no Abuſes, yea that there
were: And if you forſake the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church for Abuſes, why then do
you not forſake your own Church, and ſo be flitting from one to another? if
you had ſeen Abuſes, the way to reform them was not to make a defection
from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. He is not a good <hi>Chirurgion</hi> who
for a little pain in the Toe would cut off the whole Legg. Ye are like
<hi>Diogenes,</hi> who upon a time envying the Garments of <hi>Plato</hi>
ſaid, <hi>Ecce calco faſtum Platonis. Plato</hi> anſwered, <hi>Sed majore
faſtu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome peradventure have animated you to ſtick to your
Tackle, bearing you in hand that your Opinion is good, and that yee ſhall dye
in a good Quarrel, and God will accept your <hi>Oblation.</hi> But hear what
Chriſt faith, <hi>if thou come unto the Altar to offer thy</hi> Oblation,
<hi>and knoweſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy
gift and go and be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy
gift.</hi> This he ſaid to all the World, to the end they might underſtand
upon what terms their Offerings ſhould be accepted. Remember therefore,
before you offer up your Offering, what not one Brother but many Brothers, even
all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Church of <hi>England</hi> have to ſay
againſt you. I ſay no more than what the Church hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſay:
The Sacrifice that is offered out of the Church is not profitable: The
Premiſes therefore conſidered; for God's ſake I ſay, <hi>Memor eſto
unde excideris &amp; age paenitentiam &amp; prima opera fac.</hi> Caſt not
your ſelf away. Spare your Soul, Spare them alſo whom you have ſeduced;
and let not the Blood of Chriſt be ſhed for you in vain; harden not your
Heart, ſubmit to the received verity of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſtand
not too much in your own conceit, think not your ſelf wiſer then all
<hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> beſides, leave off your unjuſt Cavils, and believe
as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> 
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47525:29"/>Church Believes and Teaches you,
perſwade your ſelf that <hi>extra eccleſiam non eſt ſalus.</hi> And
thus much have I ſaid of Charity; if this poor Exhortation of mine may ſink
into your head and take effect with you, then have I ſaid as I would have
ſaid, otherwiſe not, as I would but as I could for this preſent, <hi>Fox.

[<hi>Dudly</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> finding that nothing went ſo
near the <pb n="46" facs="tcp:47525:30"/>King's Heart (<hi>Edward</hi> VI) as the ruin of
Religion, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended would follow upon his Death, when his Siſter
<hi>Mary</hi> ſhould come to the Crown; upon that, he and his party took
advantage to propoſe to him to ſettle the Crown by his Letters Patents on
the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> (<hi>then newly married to</hi> Guilford Dudley,
<hi>Northumberlands fourth Son</hi>) how they prevailed with him to paſs by
his Siſter <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> who had been always much in his Favour, I do
not ſo well underſtand. But the King being wrought over to this, on the
11th of <hi>June, Mountague</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Common-Pleas,
<hi>Baker</hi> and <hi>Bromly</hi> two Judges, with the King's Attorney and
Solicitor were commanded to come to Council. There they found the King with
ſome Privy-Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors about him. The King told them he did now apprehend
the danger the Kingdom might be in by the Succeſſion of his Siſter
<hi>Mary.</hi> So he ordered ſome <hi>Articles</hi> to be read to them of the
way in which he would have the Crown to deſcend. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that an Act
of Parliament could not be taken away by any ſuch <hi>Device;</hi> yet the
King required them to take the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and draw a Book according to
them. They asked a little time to conſider of it. So having examined the
Statute of the firſt year of his <hi>Reign,</hi> they found that it was
Treaſon not only after the King's Death, but in his life time to change the
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>Secretary <hi>Petre</hi> in the mean time preſſed them to
make haſte; When they came again to the Council, they declared they could not
do any ſuch thing; for it was Treaſon. And all the Lords ſhould be Guilty
of Treaſon if they went on in it. Upon which the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> who was not then in the Council Chamber, being
advertiſed of this, came in great Fury, calling <hi>Mountague</hi> a Traitor:
But the Judges ſtood to their Opinion. They were again ſent for and came on
the 15th of <hi>June.</hi> The King was preſent, and ſomewhat ſharply
asked them, why they had not prepared the Book, as he had ordered them? They
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that whatever they did would be of no force without a
<hi>Parliament.</hi> But the King ſaid, he would have it firſt done, and 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47525:30"/>then ratified in Parliament, and therefore required them on
their Allegiance to go about it; and ſome Councellors told them, if they
refuſed to <hi>Obey</hi> that, they were <hi>Traytors.</hi> This put them in
a great Conſternation; and Old <hi>Mountague</hi> thinking it could not be
Treaſon, whatever they did in this matter while the King lived, and at
worſt, that a Pardon under the great Seal would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him, conſented to
ſet about it, if he might have a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requiring him to do it, and
a Pardon when it was done; both theſe being granted him, he was ſatisfyed.
The other Judges being asked, if they would concur, did all agree, being
overcome with fear, except <hi>Hales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—But <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſtill refuſed to do it after
they had all ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; and ſaid, he would never conſent to the
Diſinheriting of the Daughters of his late Maſter. Many Conſultations
were had to perſwade him to it; but he could not be prevailed on; till the
King himſelf ſet on him, who uſed many Arguments from the danger Religion
would otherwiſe be in, together with other Perſwaſions; ſo that by his
Reaſons, or rather Importunities, at laſt he brought him to it.</p>
               <p>NOTE. <hi>The Doctors excuſe for this unjuſt Act of</hi>
Cranmers <hi>(importunity,) the ſame that naughty Women are ſaid to pretend
for their</hi> Incontinency. <hi>If he did this only as ſubmitting to
his</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>importunity, how came he after King</hi> Edward<hi>'s
Death to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the aforeſaid Letter? And to do</hi> both <hi>after he
had ſaid he he would never conſent to the diſinheriting of King</hi>
Henry<hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? The</hi> Reader <hi>may now underſtand the reaſon
why he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little or nothing to the Treaſon objected to him by the
Biſhop of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>becauſe there was too much Truth in it. And
methinks this excuſe which</hi> Burnet <hi>makes for him does him no
ſervice;</hi> namely, <hi>that he ſtood off a good while, but at laſt
with much a do was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into this Conſpiracy againſt K.</hi>
Henry<hi>'s Children. How does this anſwer the Character which</hi> Fox
<hi>gives of him,</hi> in cauſes pertaining to God and his Prince no Man more
ſtout, no Man more conſtant then he. <hi>But whether he was in reality ſo
unwilling to this</hi> Action, <hi>is a queſtion which the indifferent Reader
may eaſily reſolve: Since <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47525:31"/>he could not but apprehend
that Queen</hi> Mary <hi>would call him to an account for the troubles he had
brought upon her</hi> Mother, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon the whole Church and Kingdom
of</hi> England.<hi>For amongst all the Engliſh Biſhops</hi> (anno 1533.
<hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>could not find ſuch another Perſon (as</hi> Burnet
<hi>confeſſes) to ſerve him in the See of</hi> Canterbury.</p>

                  <hi>John Foxes</hi> words are theſe, [As for the matter of
Hereſie and Schiſm wherewith he was charged, he proteſted and called God
to witneſs that he knew none that he maintained: But if that were an
Hereſie to deny the Popes Authority and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which the See of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath publiſhed to the World theſe later years, then the
Apoſtles and Chriſt himſelf taught Hereſie; and he deſired all then

that uſurping <hi>Prelate</hi> to be moſt falſe, erroneous and againſt

that he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced himſelf above all Emperors and Kings of the World, whom
he affirmeth to hold their Eſtates and Empires of him as their Chief, and to
be depoſed at his good Will and Pleaſure.—That he hath brought in

Lucre.—This Enemy of God and of our Redemption is ſo evidently painted
out in the Scriptures by ſuch manifeſt Signs and Tokens, that except a man
will ſhut up his Eyes and Heart againſt the Light, he cannot but know
him.—He is like the Devil in his doings, for the Devil ſaid to
Chriſt, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me, I will give thee all the
Kingdoms of the World; even ſo the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> giveth Princes

be, and who ſhall he be? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth he that advanceth himſelf above all
other Creatures. Now if there be none other that hath advanced himſelf after

<hi>interpreted according to every Man's Judgment of</hi> Diſcretion. <hi>I
have ſeen a Book entituled,</hi> The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Catechiſm, compoſed for
the Parliaments Army, <hi>&amp; publiſhed in the year</hi> 1644 <hi>where
this among other Queſtions being put,</hi> What is it that you chiefly aim at
in this War againſt the King? The Anſwer is, 1. At the pulling down of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and rewarding her as ſhe hath ſerved us, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
137.8. 2. At the ſuppreſſion of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47525:32"/>Prelacy, conſiſting of <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans,</hi>
&amp;c. 3. At the Reformation of a moſt corrupt, lazy, infamous,
ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſoul-murdering Clergy. 4. At the advancement of
Chriſt's Kingdom, and the purity of his Ordinances. 5. At the bringing to
Juſtice the Enemies of our Church and State. 6. At the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
continuance of the Goſpel to our Poſterity. And to this Queſtion, <hi>Is
it not a lamentable thing that Chriſtians of the ſame Nation ſhould thus
imbrue their Hands in one anothers Blood?</hi> The Anſwer is, I confeſs it
is; but as the caſe now ſtands, there is an inevitable and abſolute
neceſſity of fighting laid upon the good People of the Land.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The whole Church of God calls upon us to come into the
help of the Lord and his People againſt the Mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>We are not now to look at our enemies as Country Men, or
Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or fellow</hi> Proteſtants; <hi>but as the Enemies of God and our
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Siders with</hi> Antichriſt; <hi>and ſo our eye is not to
pity them, nor our Sword to ſpare them,</hi> Jerem. 48.10.</p>

                  <hi>And to this Queſtion.</hi> who do you think are the
Authors and Occaſioners of this unnatural War? <hi>The Anſwer is, the

                  <hi>This Book was printed in the year</hi> 1644. <hi>and

taken up Arms in the Cauſe of God and his People, <hi>&amp;c. In which Book
the</hi> Reader <hi>ſhall find them</hi> driving the Nail to the Head,
<hi>and expounding the</hi> Scripture <hi>againſt the</hi> Proteſtant
Hierarchy, <hi>juſt as</hi> Cranmer <hi>had done againſt the</hi> Pope
<hi>and Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>For you muſt know the time when</hi> Cranmer
<hi>anſwered thus invectively againſt the</hi> Pope, was the year 1556.
<hi>the</hi> Parliament, <hi>the National</hi> Church <hi>and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of</hi>

you may find both in</hi> Burnet <hi>and</hi> Fox,) <hi>ſo that his Authority

<hi>for <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47525:32"/>calling the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Biſhops</hi>

               <p>Yes; for Catholique Religion was then reſtored by Act of

reſolve you of what Church was <hi>Cranmer</hi> at that time: a

                  <hi>Thus you ſhall find him anſwering to the Charge of
Dr.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn, <hi>viz.</hi> [I will never conſent to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> (<hi>ſo he would never conſent to the Diſinheriting of
King</hi> Henrys <hi>Children,</hi>) for then ſhould I give my ſelf to the
Devil. I have made an Oath to the King, and muſt obey the King by Gods Laws.
By the Scripture the King is Chief, and no Foreign perſon in his own Realm
above him. There is no Subject, but to a King. I am a Subject, I ow my Fidelity
to the Crown (<hi>to the Lady</hi> Jane Grey,) the Pope is contrary the Crown.
I cannot obey both; for no man can ſerve two Maſters at once, as you in the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your Oration declared by the <hi>Sword</hi> and the
<hi>Keys;</hi> artri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the <hi>Sword</hi> to the King, and the
<hi>Keys</hi> to the Pope: but I ſay, the King hath <hi>both.</hi> Therefore
he that is ſubject to <hi>Rome</hi> and the Laws of <hi>Rome</hi> he is
perjured, <hi>&amp;c. Fox pag.</hi> 653.</p>
               <p>NOTE. <hi>In his Opinion the King has both the Power of the
Sword and of the Keys. This muſt needs be a man after King</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys
<hi>own heart: but if this Doctrine be true, then Queen</hi> Mary <hi>had the
Power of the Keys; and our preſent Sovereign King</hi> James II. <hi>muſt
have the ſame Power alſo.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>He proceeds.</hi> Now as concerning the <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
I have taught no falſe Doctrine of the Sacrament of the <hi>Altar.</hi> For
if it can be proved by any <hi>Doctor</hi> above a thouſand years after
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47525:33"/>Chriſts Body is there
<hi>really,</hi> I will give over. My Book was made ſeven years ago, and no
man hath brought any Authors againſt it. I believe, that who ſo eateth and
drinketh that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is within them, whole Chriſt, his
Nativity, Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, but not that
<hi>corporally</hi> that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in Heaven—<hi>Fox ibid.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here Dr.</hi> Story, <hi>another of the Queens Proctors,

               <p>
                  <hi>To which he replyed,</hi> Now I have declared why I cannot
with my Conſcience obey the <hi>Pope;</hi> neither ſay I this for my
Defence, but to declare my Conſcience for the Zeal that I bear to Gods Word
trodden under foot by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> See the reſt in <hi>Fox,
pag.</hi> 654.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Doctor</hi> Story <hi>ſtood up and ſaid</hi>
(addreſſing himſelf to the Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi>) Pleaſeth
it your good Lordſhip, becauſe it hath pleaſed the King and Queens
Majeſty to appoint my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and me to hear the Examination of this man,
to give me leave ſomewhat to talk in that behalf: although I know that in
<hi>talk</hi> with <hi>Hereticks</hi> there cometh hurt to all men; for it
wearieth the ſtedfaſt, troubleth the doubtful, and enſnareth the weak and
ſimple; yet becauſe he ſaith, he is not bound to anſwer your Lordſhip
ſitting for the Popes Holyneſs, becauſe of a <hi>Premunire</hi> and the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> as he pretends; I think good ſomewhat to ſay, that
all men may ſee how he runneth out of his race of Reaſon into the rage of
common Talk. And as the King and Queens Majeſty will be glad to hear of your
moſt charitable dealing with him, ſo will they be weary to hear the
blundering of this ſtubborn <hi>Heretick.</hi> And where he alledgeth
Divinity min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>fas nefásque</hi> together, he ſhould not have
been heard. For ſhall it be ſufficient for him to alledge, the
<hi>Judge</hi> is not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and ſhall we diſpute <hi>contra cum qui
negat principia?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be here a great company of learned men,
that know it unmeet ſo to do; yet have I here a plain <hi>Canon</hi> whereby
he is convicted <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Canon</hi> is this; <hi>Sit ergo ruinae ſuae dolore
proſtratus, quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47525:33"/>Apoſtolicis voluerit contraire
Decretis: nec locum deinceps ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat inter Sacerdotes ſed exors à
ſancto fiat Miniſterio, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath alledged many matters againſt the <hi>Popes</hi>
Supremacy, but maliciouſly. Ye ſay that the King in his Realm is Supream
Head of the Church. Well Sir, you will grant me, that there was a perfect
<hi>Catholique Church</hi> before any King was Chriſtened. Then if it were a
perfect Church, it muſt needs have a Head; which muſt needs be before any
King was <hi>member</hi> thereof. For you know <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the
Emperor was the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King that ever was; and although
you are bound (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) to obey your Rulers, and Kings
have Rule over the People, yet doth it not follow that they have <hi>Cure of
Souls:</hi> For <hi>à fortiori</hi> the Head may do what the Miniſter
cannot do; but the Prieſt may conſecrate, and the King cannot: therefore
the King is not Head of the Church.—And where the Apoſtles do call upon
men to obey their Princes, <hi>cui Tributum, Tributum, cui Vectigal,
Vectigal;</hi> the Exhortation extendeth only to Temporal matters; they
perceiving that men were bent to <hi>Liberty</hi> and Diſobedience, were
enforced to exhort them to Obedience and Payment of their Tribute.</p>
               <p>And again, where you ſay that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
maketh Laws contrary to the Laws of the Realm, that is not true; for this is a
maxim in the <hi>Law, Quod in particulari excipitur non facit univerſale
falſum.</hi> And as touching that monſtrous talk of your
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> that is no Conſcience that ye profeſs: it is but
<hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Scientia</hi> and <hi>Secta.</hi> As yet you have not proved, for
all your glorious <hi>Babble,</hi> that by <hi>Gods Laws</hi> ye ought not to
anſwer the Popes Holineſs: The Canons which be received in all
Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom compel you to anſwer. And although this Realm of late time,
through ſuch <hi>Schiſmatiques</hi> as you were, hath exiled and baniſhed
the Canons, yet that cannot make for you: for you know your ſelf, that
<hi>pars in totum nihil ſtatuere poteſt.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this
<hi>Iſland,</hi> being indeed but a <hi>member</hi> of the whole Church,
could not determine againſt the <hi>whole.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Laws</hi>
that were put away by <hi>Parliament,</hi> are now received again by a
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> 
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47525:34"/>having as full Authority now as they
had then. And theſe Laws <hi>will</hi> now that ye anſwer to the
<hi>Popes</hi> Holineſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Laws of this Realm ye are bound to
anſwer him. (<hi>This was materially replied to</hi> Cranmers <hi>words, that
he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould have any
Juriſdiction in</hi> England.) Wherefore, my good Lord, all that this
<hi>Thomas Cranmer</hi> (I cannot otherwiſe term him, confidering his
Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) hath brought for his Defence, ſhall nothing prevail with
you. Require him therefore to anſwer directly to your good
<hi>Lordſhip;</hi> command him to ſet aſide his Trifles, and to be
obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Laws and Ordinances of this Realm, take witneſs here of his
ſtubborn Contempt againſt the King and Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, and compel him
to anſwer directly to ſuch Articles as we ſhall here exhibit againſt
him; and in refuſal, your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is to excommunicate him. Thus Dr.

the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,
Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> in his opinion was
but the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Church
conſented with the <hi>Roman</hi> in moſt of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines controverted

Adoration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> Veneration of <hi>Images,</hi>
Invocation of Saints, Prayer for the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do conſent at
this day. The Church of <hi>England</hi> was then newly reconciled to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and Catholique Biſhops reſtor'd to their own <hi>Sees</hi>
by Act of Parliament. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> did then and at this day adore a
corporal preſence in the Sacrament; and therefore cannot be ſaid (in his
opinion) to have <hi>the pure Word of God preached, and the Sacraments duely
adminiſtred according to Chriſts Ordinance.</hi> The <hi>Calviniſts</hi>
had no Orders of Prieſts and Biſhops, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Church at all.</p>

<hi>Form</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her for making and conſecrating of <hi>Biſhops,
Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and there obſerve theſe words,
<hi>viz. It is evident unto all men diligently reading holy Scripture and
ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time there hath been theſe Orders
of Miniſters in Chriſts Church,</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts <hi>and</hi>
Deacons; <hi>which Offices were evermore had in ſuch reverent eſtimation,
that no man by his own</hi> private Authority <hi>might preſume to execute
any of them, except he were firſt called,</hi> &amp;c. And Biſhop
<hi>Bramhall</hi> affirms with great aſſurance, <hi>Among all the
Eaſtern, Southern and Northern Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who make innumerable
multitudes, there neither is nor ever <pb n="56" facs="tcp:47525:35"/>was one formed Church
that wanted Biſhops—among all the Weſtern Churches and their
Colonies, there never was one formed Church for</hi> 1500 <hi>years that wanted
Biſhops. If there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo far poſſeſſed with
prejudice, that they chooſe rather to follow the private dictates of their
own Phrenſy than the perpetual and univerſal practice of the</hi>
Catholique Church, <hi>enter not into their Secrets. O my Soul.</hi> Biſhop
<hi>Bramhall,</hi> Conſecration of Proteſtant Biſhops vindicated,
<hi>p.</hi> 431. of his <hi>Works</hi> printed at <hi>Dublin.</hi> And you know
the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> practice at this day, which admits of no
<hi>Calvinian</hi> Miniſters into her Clergy without <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
Ordination.</p>
               <p>NOTE, <hi>Thus it appears by an Induction of all the ſeveral
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations of Chriſtians; that in</hi> Cranmers <hi>opinion, there could
be no ſuch National or Catholique Church extant upon the face of the
earth,</hi> anno 1556. <hi>as that which the Church of</hi> England
<hi>defines</hi> (Article 19th) The viſible Church of Chriſt is a
Congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and
the Sacraments duely adminiſtred according to Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in all
thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame. <hi>So that
his ſaying</hi> [I reverence the Authority of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church] <hi>was
but an illuſion or vain pretence to avoid the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Hereſie:
his</hi> Catholique Church <hi>at that time being like</hi> Terra incognita
<hi>in our Maps, not as yet found out. What tolerable excuſe</hi> (Good
Reader) <hi>canſt thou invent for this</hi> Reformer? <hi>have</hi>
Lutherans, Papiſts, Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts, Socinians, Greek Church,
&amp;c. <hi>all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the
preaching of Gods pure Word, and due Adminiſtration of Sacraments according
to Chriſts Ordinance? If ſo, then ſhew me a ſolid reaſon, if thou
canſt, why a Church of</hi> England <hi>man ſhould not receive the
Sacraments of all or any of theſe</hi> Sects? <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>have all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>how or where ſhall</hi> Cranmer <hi>appear at the day of Judgment? If
ſhe have not, then how is ſhe a Member of Chriſts</hi> viſible Church,
<hi>as</hi> Proteſtants <hi>ſay ſhe is?</hi> A corrupt Member <hi>perhaps
you will call her; but if ſhe wants any thing</hi> neceſſary or
eſſential <hi>to a Chriſtian Church, ſhe is no <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47525:35"/>Member at all. If ſhe</hi> errs only <hi>in matters not</hi>
Fundamental <hi>or</hi> non eſſential (<hi>as is confeſſed by very
learned</hi> Proteſtants) <hi>ſhe is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſtill,</hi> but thou art
not ſecured from <hi>Schiſm. If ſhe holds all things neceſſary to
Salvation, and no Error that deſtroys the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith,</hi> ſhe may
be ſaved, <hi>and what more wouldſt thou have? But whether ſhe does or
does not hold any Errors</hi> deſtructive of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>I pray who
ſhall be</hi> Judge? <hi>Anſwer that</hi> ſhort Queſtion, <hi>if thou

Cranmer <hi>to call the Pope</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>more than the</hi> Pope
<hi>had to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him an</hi> Heretick? He ſwore Obedience to the Pope,
which the Pope never did to him. He divorced Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi>

<hi>Vol.</hi> [He <hi>(viz. Cranmer,)</hi> ſaid ſome General Councils had
been rejected by others; and it was a tender point how much ought to be
deferred to a Council—And as all God's Promiſes to the people of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> had this Condition implyed within them, <hi>if they kept his
Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> ſo he thought the Promiſes to the Chriſtian Church
had this Condition in them, <hi>if they kept the Faith:</hi> Therefore (ſays
<hi>Burnet</hi>) he had much doubting in himſelf as to <hi>General
Councils,</hi> and he thought that only the <hi>Word of God</hi> was the Rule
of Faith, which ought to take place in all Controverſies of Religion.
<hi>This be ſaid in the year</hi> 1534.</p>
               <p>NOTE. <hi>The word of God admits of various Interpretations; the
Queſtion is, Who ſhall determine which is the true Interpretation? a
General Council, or</hi> Cranmer<hi>'s private Spirit in Oppoſition to
that</hi> Council?</p>
               <p>But his Opinion of General Councils appears further from the
XXI. Article of the Church of <hi>England, viz. General Councils when they are
gathered together, foraſmuch as they be an Aſſembly of men (whereof all
be not governed by the Spirit and Word of God) they may err, and ſometime
have erred in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things Ordained by them as
neceſſary unto Salvation have neither ſtrength nor Authority, unleſs it
may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi>

judge of the Decrees of General Councils, whether they be Conſonant to
Scripture or not? ſhall any ſingle Perſon? Or any particular Church?
Where is the Modeſty of that? Shall any inferiour Authority take upon it
ſelf to contradict or reverſe the Decrees of a Superiour? If ſo, then why
may not any ſingle</hi> Miniſter <hi>or</hi> Biſhop <hi>of the Reformed
Church proteſt againſt the Judgment of a</hi> Proteſtant Convocation? If
he may not do it without Cenſure, how ſhall the Church of <hi>England,</hi>

Since a Church may be drowned in damnable Idolatry, and yet (as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants

other part of your Oration, wherein you bring in Gods Word, that you have it on
your ſide, and no man elſe; and that the Pope hath deviſed a new
<hi>Scripture</hi> contrary to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God. Ye play herein
as the <hi>Phareſees</hi> did, who cried always, <hi>Verbum Domini, Verbum
Domini, the Word of the Lord, the Word of the Lord,</hi> when they meant
nothing ſo: This betters not your Cauſe; for <hi>Baſilides</hi> and
<hi>Photinus</hi> the Heretiques ſaid, they had Gods Word to maintain their
<hi>Hereſie;</hi> ſo <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> ſo <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> ſo
<hi>Pelagius,</hi> and briefly all the Heretiques that ever were, pretended
Gods Word for themſelves: Yea, and the Devil, the Father of Hereſies,
alledged Gods Word for himſelf, ſaying; <hi>ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptum eſt, it is
written:</hi> ſo ſaid he to Chriſt, <hi>mitte te deorſum; caſt thy
ſelf downward,</hi> which you applied moſt falſely againſt the 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47525:38"/>
                           <hi>Pope.</hi> And if you mark well the Devils language, it
agreed with your proceedings moſt truly. For <hi>mitte te deorſum, caſt
thy ſelf downward</hi> (ſaid he); and ſo taught you to caſt all things
down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; down with the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> down with the <hi>Maſs,</hi>
down with the <hi>Altars,</hi> down with the <hi>Arms</hi> of Chriſt, and up
with a <hi>Lyon</hi> and a <hi>Dog;</hi> down with the <hi>Abbies,</hi>
Hoſpitals, Chauntries and Colledges; down with Faſting and Prayer; yea,
down with all that good and godly is: all your proceedings and preachings
tended to no other end, but to fulfill the Devils requeſt, <hi>mitte te
deorſum:</hi> and therefore tell us not that you have Gods Word; for God hath
given us by his Word a <hi>mark</hi> to know that your Teaching proceeded not
of <hi>God,</hi> but of the <hi>Devil;</hi> and that your Doctrine came not of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told there
ſhould ariſe againſt his Church <hi>Lupi rapaces, ravening Wolves,</hi>
and <hi>Pſeudo-Apoſtoli, falſe Apoſtles.</hi> But how ſhall we know
them? Chriſt teaches us, ſaying, <hi>ex fructibus eorum cognoſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eos,
by their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> Why, what be their fruits? St.
<hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>Poſt carnem in concupiſcentia &amp;
immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie ambulant, Poteſtates contemnunt, &amp;c. they walk after the
fleſh in concupiſcence and uncleanneſs, they contemn Dominions.</hi>
Again, <hi>in diebus noviſſimis erunt periculoſa tempora, erunt
ſeipſos amantes, cupidi, elati, immorigeri Parentibus, Proditores, &amp;c.
in the later days there ſhall be perilous times, men lovers of themſelves,
cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, diſobedient to Parents, Treaſon-workers, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whether theſe be not the Fruits of your Goſpel, I
refer me unto this worſhipful <hi>Audience,</hi> whether the ſaid
<hi>Goſpel</hi> began not with Perjury, proceeded with Adultery, was
maintained with Hereſie, and ended in <hi>Conſpiracy.</hi>

                        <p>Now Sir, two points more I marked in your <hi>raging</hi>

                        </p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Martyn.</speaker>
                        <p>That is to ſay, the Catholique and Univerſal Doctrine
of <hi>Chriſts Church.</hi> And how, when K. <hi>Henry</hi> died, did you not
tranſlate <hi>Juſtus Jonas</hi>'s Book?</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Martyn.</speaker>
                        <p>There you defended another Doctrine touching the
Sacrament: by the ſame token, that you ſent to <hi>Lynne,</hi> your
Printer, that whereas in the firſt Print there was an <hi>Affirmative,</hi>
that is to ſay, Chriſts Body really in the Sacrament, you ſent then to
your <hi>Printer</hi> to put in a <hi>not;</hi> wherby it came miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
to paſs, that Chriſts Body was clean conveyed out of the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>Then from a <hi>Lutheran</hi> ye became a

the high Myſtery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, (and for the ſame Hereſie you did
help to burn <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the <hi>Sacramentary,</hi>) which you now call

                        <p>Ah, why told you not King <hi>Henry</hi> this, when you

                        <p>I mean not, but that every King in his own Realm and

Chriſt. [<hi>Reader, Obſerve here how he makes the Catholique Church

                        <p>Nay it is true, for <hi>Nero</hi> was Head of the Church;
that is, in reſpect of the temporal Bodies of Men, of whom the Church
conſiſteth; for ſo he beheaded <hi>Peter</hi> and the

proceeded to examine him of divers <hi>Articles;</hi> whereof the chief was,
that at the time of his creating Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> he was
ſworn to the Pope, and had his <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Induction</hi>
from him; and promiſed then to maintain the Authority of that <hi>See,</hi>
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was perjured: wherefore he ſhould rather ſtick to his
firſt <pb n="67" facs="tcp:47525:40"/>Oath, and return to his old <hi>fold</hi> again,
than continue obſtinately in an Oath <hi>forced</hi> in the time of
<hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that he anſwered (ſays <hi>Fox</hi>) ſaving his
<hi>Proteſtation</hi> (which <hi>term</hi> he uſed before all his
<hi>Anſwers</hi>) that at ſuch time as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Warham</hi> dyed,
he was Ambaſſador in <hi>Germany</hi> for the King; who thereupon ſent
for him home; and having intelligence by ſome of his Friends (near about the
King) how he meant to beſtow the ſame Biſhoprick upon him, and therefore
counſelled him in that caſe to make haſte home; he feeling in himſelf a
great inability to ſuch a Promotion, and very ſorry to leave his Study; and
eſpecially conſidering by what means he muſt have it, which was clean
againſt his Conſcience, which he could not utter without great peril and
danger, deviſed an Excuſe to the <hi>King</hi> of matter of great
importance, for the which his longer abode there ſhould be moſt
neceſſary, thinking by that means in his abſence, the King would beſtow
it upon ſome other; and ſo remained there by that device one half year
after the King had written for him to come; but after that no ſuch matter
fell out, as he ſeemed to make ſuſpicion of, the King ſent for him
again. Who after his return, underſtanding ſtill the
<hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> to be reſerved for him, made means by divers of his
beſt Friends to ſhift it off; deſiring rather ſome ſmaller
<hi>Living,</hi> that he might more quietly follow his Book.</p>
               <p>To be brief, when the King himſelf ſpake with him, declaring
that his full intention was for his Service ſake <hi>(note this)</hi> and for
the good opinion he conceived of him, to beſtow that Dignity upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fox</hi> proceeds. After long diſabling of himſelf,
perceiving he could by no perſwaſions alter the Kings determination, he
brake frankly his Conſcience with him, moſt humbly craving firſt his
<hi>Graces</hi> Pardon for what he ſhould declare unto his
<hi>Highneſs</hi> Which obtained, he ſaid, that if he accepted the Office,
he muſt receive it at the <hi>Popes</hi> hand, which he neither would nor
could do, His <hi>Highneſs</hi> being the only Supream Governour of this
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal
(this was a <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47525:41"/>
                  <hi>Chaplain</hi> after King <hi>Henry</hi>'s
own Heart.) And therefore if he might in that Vocation ſerve God, the King,
and his Country; ſeeing it was his pleaſure ſo to have it, he would
accept that Dignity, and receive it of his Majeſty, and of no
<hi>Stranger,</hi> who had no Authority within this Realm. Whereat the King,
ſaid he, ſtaying a while and muſing, asked me, How I was able to prove
that. At which time I alledged many Texts out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the
<hi>Fathers</hi> alſo, approving the Supream and higheſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of
Kings within their own Realms, ſhewing withall the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable uſurpation
of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards it pleaſed his Highneſs (quoth the Archbiſhop)
many and ſundry times to talk with me about it; and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I could
not be brought to acknowledge the Authority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
the King himſelf called Doctor <hi>Oliver,</hi> and other Civil
<hi>Lawyers</hi> to adviſe with them how he might beſtow the
Archbiſhoprick upon me, inforcing me nothing againſt my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; who
thereupon informed him, that I might do it by the way of
<hi>Proteſtation;</hi> and ſo one to be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> who might
take the Oath and do every thing in my name; which when I underſtood, I
ſaid, he ſhould do it <hi>ſuper Animam ſuam.</hi> And I indeed <hi>bona
fide</hi> made by <hi>Proteſtation:</hi> that I did not acknowledge his
Authority any further then as it agreed with the expreſs Word of God: And
that it might be lawful for me at all times to ſpeak againſt him, and to
impugn his Errors when time and occaſion ſhould ſerve me. And this my
<hi>Proteſtation</hi> I did cauſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled; and there I think it
remains.</p>

               <p>He made a long Speech, the effect whereof was this; [Maſter
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> (I cannot otherwiſe term you conſidering your
obſtinacy) I am right heartily ſorry to hear ſuch words eſcape your
mouth ſo unadviſedly: I had conceived a right good hope of your amendment.
I ſuppoſed that this obſtinacy of yours came not of vain Glory, but
rather of a corrupt Conſcience; but now I perceive by your fooliſh
<hi>babble,</hi> that it is far otherwiſe. Ye are ſo puffed up with Vain
Glory; there is ſuch a <hi>cauterium</hi> of Hereſie crept into your
Conſcience, that I am clean void of hope. God would have you to be ſaved,
and you refuſe it. You have uttered ſuch erroneous talk, with ſuch open
malice againſt the <hi>Popes</hi> Holineſs, with ſuch open <hi>lying</hi>
againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſuch open Blaſphemy againſt
the Sacrament of the <hi>Altar,</hi> that no mouth could have expreſſed
more maliciouſly, more lyingly, more blaſphemouſly.</p>
               <p>To reaſon with you, although I would of my ſelf to
ſatisfie this <hi>Audience:</hi> yet I may not do ſo by our
<hi>Commiſſion;</hi> neither do I find how I may do it by the
<hi>Scriptures;</hi> for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, <hi>Haereticum
hominem poſt unum aut alterum conventum, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vita, &amp;c.</hi> an heretical
perſon after once or twice conferring, ſhun, knowing that he is perverſe,
and ſinneth, being of his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47525:42"/>condemned. Ye
have been conferred withal not once or twice but oftentimes; ye have oft been
lovingly admoniſhed, ye have oft been privately diſputed with; and the
laſt year in the open School in open Diſputations ye have been openly
convict. Your Book, which ye bragg ye made ſeven years ago, and no man
anſwered it, <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> hath ſufficiently detected and
confuted: yet ye perſiſt ſtill in your wonted <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore being ſo oft admoniſhed, conferred withal, and
convicted, if ye deny your ſelf to be the <hi>man</hi> whom the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> noteth, hear then what <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, who wrote
above 1300 years ago, and interpreteth that <hi>ſaying</hi> of the Apoſtle
in this wiſe, <hi>in Apologia Pamphili, Haereticus eſt omnis ille habendus
qui Chriſto ſe credere profitetur &amp; aliter de Chriſti veritate
ſentit quam ſe habet eccleſiaſtica Traditio.</hi> Ye rehearſed the
Articles of your Faith; to what end, I pray you, but to cloak that Hereſie
root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you, and to blind the poor ſimple and unlearned peoples eyes? for
unleſs (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith) ye believe all things that the Church
hath decreed, ye are no Chriſtian man; in the which, becauſe ye do halt;
and will come to no <hi>Conformity,</hi> from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ye are to be taken
for an <hi>Heretique,</hi> whom we ought to eſchew and avoid.</p>
               <p>And firſt, where you accuſe me of an Oath taken againſt
the Bp. of <hi>Rome</hi> I confeſs it, and therefore do ſay with the reſt
of this <hi>Realm,</hi> good and Catholique men, the words of the Prophet,
<hi>Peccavimus cum Patribus noſtris, injuſte egimus, iniquitatem ſecimus.
We have ſinned with our Fathers, we have done unjuſtly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Scholar here in the Univerſity. I knew not what an Oath did mean.</p>
               <p>And where you ſay I took two Oaths, the one contrary to the
other. It is not ſo; for the Oath I made to the <hi>Popes</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
appeartains only to ſpiritual things: the other that I made to the King,
pertains only to temporal things; that is to ſay, that I do acknowledge all
my Temporal Livings to proceed only from <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47525:42"/>the King, and from
none elſe; but all men may ſee, as ye agree in this, ſo ye agree in the
reſt of your Opinions.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as concerning the Supremacy due to the See of
<hi>Rome;</hi> although there be a number of places to prove that Chriſt
appointed <hi>Peter</hi> Head of the Church, yet this place is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
when Chriſt demanded of his Apoſtles, <hi>Whom do men ſay that I am?</hi>
They anſwered, <hi>Some</hi> Elias, <hi>ſome one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
&amp;c. but to <hi>Peter</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Whom ſaveſt thou that I am?
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> anſwered, <hi>Tu es Chriſtus fiilius Dei, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt
replied, <hi>Tu es Petrus &amp; ſuper hanc Petram aedificabo Eccleſiam
meam.</hi> The Doctors interpreting this place, <hi>ſuper hanc Petram,</hi>
expound it, <hi>id eſt, non ſolum ſuper Fidem Petri, ſed ſuper
te</hi> Petre. And why did Chriſt change his Name from <hi>Simon</hi> to
<hi>Peter,</hi> but only to declare that he was to be (under Chriſt) the
<hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>Again where Chriſt demanded of <hi>Peter,</hi> being amongſt
the reſt of the Apoſtles, three times, <hi>Petre amas me?</hi> he gave him
charge over his Sheep, <hi>Paſce Oves meas, paſce Agnos meos, paſce Agnos
meos,</hi> three times. Which place Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting, ſaith, <hi>Paſce, hoc eſt loco mei eſto Praepoſitus
&amp; caput fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum tuorum.</hi> And when they came that required
<hi>Didrachma</hi> of Chriſt; he commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to caſt his Net
into the Sea, and to take out of the Fiſhes Mouth <hi>ſtateram, hoc eſt,
duplex didrachma, &amp; da inquit pro te &amp; me Petre.</hi> Which words do
ſignifie that when he had paid for them two, he had paid for all the reſt.
So St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> in 75 quaeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> veteris &amp; novi Teſtamenti.
<hi>Salvator</hi> (inquit) <hi>quum pro ſe &amp; Petro dari jubebat
didrachma, pro omnibus dari cenſuit, ipſum enim conſtituit caput eorum.
Our Saviour Chriſt</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>) <hi>commanding the
Tribute to be given for Him and for</hi> Peter, <hi>meant the ſame to be
given for all the reſt. For he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him Head of the reſt:</hi> what
can be more plain then this? But I will not tarry upon this matter.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the <hi>Popes</hi> Laws, which be contrary, as
you ſay, to the Laws of God; becauſe the Service is in <hi>Latin,</hi>
which ought to be in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I Anſwer, whoſoever will take the
pains <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47525:43"/>to peruſe that Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. ſhall
find that his meaning is concerning <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>obiter</hi>
only of <hi>Praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Where you ſay that the <hi>Popes</hi> Holyneſs takes
away one part of the Sacrament from the <hi>Laity;</hi> which Chriſt
commanded to be given under both kinds, ſaying, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes.</hi>
Now if a Man would be ſo proterve with you, he might ſay that Chriſt
commanded it to be given only to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> into whoſe places
ſucceeded <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and not <hi>Laymen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And admit that Chriſt commanded it to be received under both
kinds. So he commanded his Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Ite praedicate Evangelium
omni nationi, Baptiſantes in nomine Patris &amp; Filii &amp; ſpiritus
ſancti.</hi> But the Apoſtles, being deſirous to publiſh Chriſts name
every where, did Baptiſe only in Chriſt's name. Again, Chriſt before his
laſt Supper waſhed his Diſciples Feet, ſaying, <hi>Si ego lavi pedes
veſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, &amp;c.</hi> If I being
your Lord and Maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh the
feet of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. This was a <hi>Precept:</hi> yet hath the Church altered
it, leſt the ſimple people ſhould think a <hi>Re-baptization</hi> in it.
<hi>(Why do not Proteſtants obſerve Chriſts Inſtitution of waſhing
one anothers feet before they receive the Sacrament!)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Accepi a Domino quod
&amp; tradidi vobis, &amp;c. I have received of the Lord the ſame which I
delivered unto you, that our Lord the ſame night that he was betrayed,</hi>
&amp;c. notwithſtanding Chriſts Precept, that the Sacrament ſhould be
adminiſtred after <hi>Supper,</hi> the Church hath commanded it to be
received faſting, <hi>(and Proteſtants do receive it before dinner.)</hi>
And where Chriſt did break the Bread, we receive the whole <hi>Hoſt.</hi>
Chriſt miniſtred ſitting at the Table, we ſtanding at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is commanded in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that
Chriſtians ſhould abſtain <hi>à ſuffocato &amp; ſanguine, from
things ſtrangled and from blood;</hi> but the Church hath altered it,
<hi>(nor do Proteſtants obſerve it.)</hi> God commanded the Sabbath or
<hi>Seventh</hi> day to be kept holy, the Church hath altered it to the
<hi>Sunday.</hi> If then the <hi>Church</hi> may change things ſo expreſly
appointed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſhe may <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47525:43"/>alſo change
the form of the <hi>Laitys</hi> receiving under both kinds, and that for divers
reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in carrying it to the Sick, the <hi>Blood</hi> may
not be ſhed, loſt or miſuſed.</p>
               <p>Next, That no occaſion might be given to <hi>Heretiques,</hi>
to think, that there is not ſo much under one <hi>kind,</hi> as under
both.</p>
               <p>But why would you have it under both kinds? only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and
contradict the Practice of the Church? For when you have it under both kinds,
ye believed in neither <hi>(meaning a real preſence in neither.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as concerning the Sacrament of the <hi>Altar,</hi>
where you ſay, you have a number of <hi>Doctors</hi> on your ſide, and we
none of ours: indeed <hi>one</hi> to ſtop your mouth I think it not
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find. Nevertheleſs, whereas your deſire is to have
<hi>one</hi> ſhewed you, and then you will recant, I will ſhew you
<hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferebatur manibus ſuis,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin
ſuper Pſal.</hi> 33. I find not how this is true in <hi>David</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>literally,</hi> that he was born in his own hands: but in Chriſt I
find it true <hi>literally,</hi> when he gave his Body to his Apoſtles at his
laſt <hi>Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, St. <hi>Cyprian de Coena Domini</hi> ſaith, <hi>Panis
quem Dominus Diſcipulis porrigebat, non effigie ſed natura mutatus,
Omnipotentia Verbi factus eſt Caro.</hi> What can be more plain than this?
yet to you it is not plain enough. But give me your <hi>figurative,
ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative</hi> and ſuch other like <hi>terms,</hi> and I will defend,
that Chriſt hath not yet aſcended, no, nor yet that he was
<hi>incarnate.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can only put you in the number of thoſe whom
S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Audi, homo fidelis, qui contra
Haereticum contendis, &amp;c.</hi> Hear, O thou <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> canſt
thou hope to do more than Chriſt? Chriſt confuted the <hi>Phareſees,</hi>
yet could not put them to ſilence. <hi>Et tu fortior es Chriſto?</hi> Wilt
thou go about to ſilence him that will receive no Anſwer? Thus much have I
ſaid, not for you, Mr. <hi>Cranmer;</hi> for my hope that I conceived of you
is now paſt and gone: but ſomewhat to ſatisfie the rude &amp; unlearned
people, that they, perceiving your Arrogancy, may the better eſchew your

(ſaith <hi>Fox</hi>) thus inferred in words.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Cranmer,</hi> you have made a goodly
<hi>Proceſs</hi> concerning your <hi>Heretical</hi> Oath made to the King;
but you forget your <hi>Oath</hi> made to the <hi>See Apoſtolique.</hi> As
concerning your Oath to the <hi>King,</hi> if you made it to him only, it took
an end by his Death, and ſo it is releaſed: if to his

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:47525:44"/>In the year 1551. the fifth year of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was
taken up with more heat than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. The Emperors earneſt Suit that ſhe
might have <hi>Maſs</hi> ſaid in her Houſe was long rejected—Yet
the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> making his Friendſhip at that time
neceſſary to the King, and he refuſing to continue in his League,
unleſs his Kinſwoman obtained that Favour, it was promiſed, that for
ſome time, in hope ſhe would <hi>reform,</hi> there ſhould be a
Forbearance granted. The Emperors Ambaſſador preſſed to have a
<hi>Licenſe</hi> for it under the great Seal; it was anſwered, that being
againſt <hi>Law,</hi> it could not be done.—The two grounds ſhe went
upon, were, that ſhe would follow the <hi>ancient</hi> and
<hi>univerſal</hi> way of Worſhip, and not a <hi>new Invention</hi> that
lay within the Four Seas <hi>(theſe were her words)</hi> and that ſhe would
continue in that Religion in which her Father, King <hi>Henry,</hi> had
inſtructed her. To this the King ſent an Anſwer, (<hi>he was then
ſcarce</hi> 14 <hi>years of age</hi>) telling her, that ſhe was a part of
this Church and Nation, and ſo muſt conform her ſelf to the Laws of it
(<hi>the Laws made by</hi> Cranmer, Sommerſet, Dudley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and
that the way of <hi>Worſhip</hi> now ſet up, was no other than what was
clearly conſonant to the pure Word of God, (<hi>that was King</hi> Edwards
<hi>firſt Common Prayer Book, which expreſly commanded Prayers for the
dead.</hi>) After this ſhe was ſent for to Court, and pains was taken to
inſtruct her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but ſhe refuſed to enter into any Reaſonings, and
claimed the Promiſe that was ſaid to be made to the <hi>Emperor.</hi> But
it was told her, that it was but temporary and conditional. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the
laſt Summer (<hi>anno</hi> 1550.) ſhe was deſigning to fly out of
<hi>England</hi>—The <hi>Emperors</hi> Ambaſſador ſolicited for her
violently; and ſaid, he would preſently take leave, and proteſt that they
had broken their Faith to his Maſter, who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Uſage of the
Lady <hi>Mary</hi> as highly as if it were done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to himſelf. The
Privy <hi>Counſellors</hi> having no mind to draw a new War on their Heads,
eſpecially from ſo victorious a Prince, were all inclined to let the matter
fall. There was alſo a Years Cloth lately ſent over to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
and 1500 Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47525:45"/>of Powder, with a great deal of Armour,
bought there for the King's uſe, was not come over. So it was thought by no
means adviſable to provoke the Emperor, while they had ſuch effects in his
Ports: Nor were they very willing to give higher Provocations to the next Heir
of the Crown. Therefore they all adviſed the King not to do more in that
matter at preſent, but to leave the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> to her Diſcretion;
who would certainly be made more Cautious by what ſhe had met with, and would
give as little ſcandal as was poſſible by her <hi>Maſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But King <hi>Edward</hi> could not be induced to give way to it,
for he thought the <hi>Maſs</hi> was Impious and Idolatrous (<hi>as</hi>
Cranmer, <hi>and the reſt of his Tutors had inſtructed him,</hi>) ſo he
would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the continuance of ſuch a Sin. Upon this the Council
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Poinet</hi> (<hi>the new Biſhops
of</hi> Wincheſter) to diſcourſe with him about it. They told him it was
always a Sin in a Prince to permit any Sin, but to give a <hi>Connivance;</hi>
that is, not to Puniſh, was not always a <hi>Sin.</hi> Since ſometimes a
leſſer Evil connived at might prevent a greater. He was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by this,
yet not ſo eaſily, but that he burſt forth into Tears, lamenting his
Siſters obſtinacy, and that he muſt ſuffer her to continue in ſo
abominable a way of Worſhip as he eſteemed the <hi>Maſs. Burnet,</hi>

               <p>Reader, <hi>Obſerve here the Caſuiſtry of theſe new
Apoſtles</hi> Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley, <hi>and</hi> Poinet, <hi>&amp;c. governing
the Conſcience of this young King. At his Fathers death they all went to</hi>
Maſs: <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>was no ſooner dead, but they repreſent it
to King</hi> Edward <hi>as the moſt impious and deteſtable Idolatry, not to
be tolerated by any</hi> Chriſtian <hi>King He underſtood not their</hi>
Knavery, <hi>being then</hi> (anno 1546.) <hi>a Child of nine years old; but
verily thought them (what they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be) the moſt ſincere
Chriſtians. After four or five years, he is amazed to find the</hi> Spirt
<hi>of</hi> Reformation <hi>appearing with a</hi> Cloven foot, <hi>and

                  <hi>Burnet informs you,</hi> that King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Council being now leſs in fear of the
<hi>Emperor</hi>—In <hi>July</hi> (<hi>anno</hi> 1551) ſent for
<hi>Ingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Walgrave</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> three of the Lady
<hi>Marys</hi> chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and gave them Inſtructions to ſignifie unto
her the Kings Pleaſure to have the new Service in her Family (<hi>theſe
are</hi> Burnets <hi>words</hi>) and to return with an Anſwer. In
<hi>Auguſt</hi> they came back, and ſaid, ſhe received the Meſſage
very grievouſly; and that ſhe would obey the King in all things, except
where her Conſcience was touched. Upon this they were ſent to the
<hi>Tower.</hi> Then the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> Sir <hi>Authony
Wingfield,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Petre</hi> were ſent unto <hi>her</hi>
with a Letter from the King, and Inſtructions from the Council. They came to
her Houſe at <hi>Copthall</hi> in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex.</hi> The Lord
<hi>Chancellor</hi> gave her the Kings Letter, which ſhe received on her
knees, and ſaid, ſhe paid that reſpect to the Kings <hi>Hand,</hi> and
not to the Matter of the Letter, which ſhe knew proceeded from the
<hi>Council.</hi> And when ſhe read it, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Ah! Mr.</hi> Cecil
<hi>took much pains here (he was then Secretary of State);</hi> ſo ſhe
turned to the Counſellors, and bid them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Meſſage to her,
wiſhing them to be ſhort; for ſhe was not well at eaſe. The Lord
Chancellor told her, that all the Council were of one mind, that ſhe muſt
be no longer ſuffered to have private <hi>Maſs</hi> or a <hi>Form</hi> of
Religion different from what was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He went to read the Names of thoſe that were of that mind; but
ſhe deſired him to ſpare his pains, ſhe knew they were all of a ſort.
They next told her, they had Order to require her Chaplains to uſe no other
Service than what was according to <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She anſwered, ſhe was the Kings moſt obedient Subject and
Siſter; and would obey him in every thing, but where her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience held
her, and would willingly ſuffer Death to do him Service: but ſhe would lay
her Head on a Block, rather than uſe any other <hi>Form</hi> of Service, than
what had been at her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Death; only ſhe thought <hi>(obſerve
this)</hi> ſhe was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer Death upon ſo good an account.
When the King <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47525:46"/>came to be of Age, ſo that he could order
theſe things himſelf; ſhe would obey his Commands in Religion. For
although he <hi>(Good, Sweet King)</hi> theſe were her words, had more
Knowledge than any of his years, yet he was not a fit Judge in theſe
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For if a Ship were to be ſet to Sea, or any matter of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to be
determined, they would not think him fit for it; much leſs could he be able
to reſolve Points of <hi>Divinity.</hi>

               <p>'Tis this. On the 12th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1549. (<hi>the third
year of</hi> Edward VI) a Complaint was brought to the <hi>Council,</hi> that
with the Strangers that were come into <hi>England,</hi> ſome
<hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts</hi> had come over, and were diſſeminating their Errors
and making Proſelites: ſo a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was ordered for the
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Wirceſter,
Weſtminſter, Chicheſter, Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter, &amp;c.</hi>
and ſome others, three of them being a <hi>Quorum,</hi> to examine and
ſearch after all Anabaptiſts, <hi>Heretiques</hi> or Contemners of the
<hi>Common Prayer.</hi> They were to endeavour to reclaim them, to enjoyn them
<hi>Penance,</hi> and give them <hi>Abſolution:</hi> or if they were
obſtinate, to excommunicate and impriſon them; and to deliver them over to
the ſecular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be further proceeded againſt. Some Tradeſmen in
<hi>London</hi> were brought before theſe Commiſſioners in <hi>May,</hi>
and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to abjure their Opinions, which were, <hi>that a man
regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate could not ſin; that though the outward man finned, the inward man
ſinned not. That there was no Trinity of Perſons, that Chriſt was only a
holy Prophet, and not at all God: that the Baptiſm of <pb n="79" facs="tcp:47525:46"/>Infants was not profitable. That Chriſt took no Fleſh of the
Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of thoſe, who thus abjured, was commanded to carry a
Faggot next <hi>Sunday</hi> at Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> where there ſhould be a
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſetting forth his <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But there was another of
theſe extream obſtinate, <hi>Joan Bocher,</hi> commonly called
<hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Kent, ſhe denied that Chriſt was truly incarnate of
the Virgin, whoſe Fleſh being ſinful, he could take none of it: but the
Word, by the conſent of the inward man in the Virgin,</hi> took <hi>Fleſh
of her.</hi> Theſe were her words. They took much pains about her, and had
many Conferences with her; but ſhe was ſo extravagantly conceited of her
own Notions, that ſhe rejected all they ſaid with ſcorn; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe
was adjudged an obſtinate <hi>Heretique;</hi> and ſo left to the ſecular
Power. This being returned to the <hi>Council,</hi> the good King was moved to
ſign a Warrant for burning her; but could not be prevailed on to do it. He
thought it a piece of Cruelty too like that (ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>) which they
had condemned in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to burn any for their Conſciences.
<hi>Cranmer</hi> was employed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to ſign the
<hi>Warrant.</hi> He argued from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which
Blaſphemers were to be ſtoned: he told the King, he made a great difference
between Errors in other Points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and thoſe that were directly
againſt the Apoſtles <hi>Creed:</hi> That theſe were Impieties againſt
God, which a Prince, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods Deputy, ought to puniſh, as the Kings
<hi>Deputies</hi> were obliged to puniſh Offences againſt the Kings
<hi>Perſons.</hi> Theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did rather ſilence than ſatisfie the
young King; who ſtill thought it a hard thing (as in truth it was, ſays
<hi>Burnet</hi>) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo ſeverely in ſuch caſes. So he ſet his
hand to the Warrant with tears in his eyes, ſaying to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that
if he did wrong, ſince it was in ſubmiſſion to your Authority, you
ſhall anſwer for it to God. This ſtruck the Archbiſhop with much
horror, ſo that he was very unwilling to have the Sentence executed. <hi>(Her
Crime was nothing elſe but that ſhe had read the Bible, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it
according to that Judgment of Diſcretion which</hi> Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>allow'd to
every one.)</hi> But he and <hi>Ridley</hi> took the Woman <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47525:47"/>then in cuſtody to their Houſes, to ſee if they could perſuade
her. But ſhe continued to carry her ſelf ſo contemptuouſly, that at
laſt the Sentence was executed on her, the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> next
year, and ſhe was burnt.</p>
               <p>This Action (ſaith <hi>Burnet</hi>) was much cenſured, as
being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Clemency of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and was oft made
uſe of by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſaid it was plain that the
<hi>Reformers</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt <hi>Burning,</hi> when they were in
fear of it themſelves. And the Womans Carriage made her be lookt on as a
frantick perſon, fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than a <hi>Stake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two years after this, one <hi>George Pare</hi> a
<hi>Dutchman</hi> was burnt, for ſaying, that Chriſt was not Very God.</p>
               <p>In all the Books publiſhed in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days,
juſtifying her Severity againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> theſe
inſtances were always made uſe of, and no part of <hi>Cranmers</hi> Life
expoſed him more then this did. <hi>Burnet, p.</hi> 111, 112. 2.

                  <hi>He tells us moreover,</hi> It was ſaid he had conſented
both to <hi>Lamberts</hi> and <hi>Ann Askows</hi> Death in King <hi>Henrys</hi>
Reign, who both ſuffered for Opinions, which <hi>Cranmer</hi> himſelf held
now in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days. <hi>Burnet, ibid.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And now,</hi> Reader, <hi>obſerve the Excuſe which</hi>
Burnet <hi>makes for him.</hi> One thing was certain, that what he did in this
matter, flowed from no Cruelty of Temper in him; but it was truly the effect of
thoſe Principles by which he governed himſelf. <hi>ibid. p.</hi> 112.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is plain, that the</hi> Reformers <hi>were only againſt
Burning, when they were in fear of it themſelves. No body can judge of</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I cannot undertake to anſwer all the difficulties of that

               <p>You muſt excuſe him for that miſtake. He has enough to do
(and perhaps more than an <hi>ingenious</hi> man would deſire to undertake)
to ſatisfie the <hi>itching Ears</hi> of his <hi>Congregation</hi> with a
<hi>ſpick</hi> and <hi>ſpan new</hi> Sermon every <hi>Sunday</hi> in the
year, beſides other Parochial Duties, and cannot know every thing as he
pretends. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> informs you, how in the year 1534.
<hi>Cromwell</hi> joyning himſelf to <hi>Cranmer</hi> in a firm Friendſhip,
did promote the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation very vigorouſly; but there was another party in
Court that wreſtled much againſt it, whereof the Duke of <hi>Norfold</hi>
was Head; whoſe great Friend was <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who deſpiſed <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and hated all
<hi>Reformation: Longland,</hi> that had been the Kings Confeſſor, was
alſo managed by them; and they had a great Party in Court, and <hi>(mark
this)</hi> almoſt all the Churchmen were on their ſide. <hi>Burnet, p.</hi>
172. 1. <hi>vol. Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Churchmen were againſt</hi>
Cranmer.</p>
               <p>Then in the year 1540. <hi>Cranmer</hi> (<hi>ſays</hi> Burnet)
was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Seven</hi> Sacraments to <hi>Two,</hi> but the
Popiſh Party was then prevalent; ſo the old number of Seven was agreed to,
<hi>pag.</hi> 289. 1. <hi>vol.</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſubſcribed with
the reſt, tho againſt his own opinon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was far from the unanimous Conſent of the
Clergy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:47525:48"/>In the Reign of King <hi>Edward, anno</hi>
1547. while the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſitting, they were not idle in the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> though the Popiſh party (<hi>theſe are</hi> Burnets
<hi>words</hi>) was yet ſo prevalent in both Houſes (of
<hi>Convocation</hi>) that <hi>Cranmer</hi> had no hopes of doing any thing
till they were freed of the trouble which ſome of the great Biſhops gave
them, <hi>p.</hi> 47. 2. <hi>vol. that is, till thoſe Biſhops were purged
out.</hi> And reckoning the number of Biſhops that were of <hi>Cranmers</hi>
ſide <hi>anno</hi> 1547. all he could find were theſe, <hi>viz.
Holgate</hi> of <hi>York, Holbeach</hi> of <hi>Lincoln, Goodrick</hi> of
<hi>Ely</hi> &amp; <hi>Ridley</hi> elect of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and
<hi>Latimer.</hi> Others of the Biſhops were ignorant and weak men (ſays
<hi>Burnet</hi>) who underſtood Religion little and valued it leſs
<hi>(meaning his new Reformation);</hi> and ſo though they liked the old
Superſtition beſt <hi>(that is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion)</hi> yet they
reſolved to ſwim with the ſtream, <hi>p.</hi> 25. 2 <hi>vol.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That ſame year there was a Committee of ſelected Biſhops
&amp; Divines for examining all the Offices of the Church, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them, (ſays <hi>Burnet.</hi>)—The thing they firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined was the
Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharſt,</hi> and here they mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Enquiries in
the ſame manner that was uſed in King <hi>Henrys</hi> Reign: in which when
any thing was conſidered in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Change, it was put into ſeveral
<hi>Queries,</hi> to which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in Commiſſion was to give his
Anſwer in Writing. Some of the Queries were theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> What was
the Oblation or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs? wherein the Maſs conſiſted?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe the Biſhops made their ſeveral Anſwers, by
which the Reader will perceive (ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>) how generally the
Biſhops were addicted to the old Superſtition, and how few did agree in all
things with <hi>Cranmer p.</hi> 61, 62. 2. <hi>vol.</hi>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:47525:49"/>Diſſenters from the <hi>Reformation</hi>
were generally turned out of their <hi>Sees. For the moſt part the Prelates
were changed</hi> (ſays <hi>Fox</hi>) <hi>and the dumb Biſhops compelled to
give place to others that would preach.</hi> p. 1180 And that all things might
be carried with as little oppoſition and noiſe as might be (ſaith
<hi>Heylin,</hi>) it was thougt fit that Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> of
<hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſhould be kept in Priſon till the end of the

               <p>
                  <hi>Heylin</hi> adds. And though the Parliament conſiſted of
ſuch Members as diſagreed amongſt themſelves in reſpect of Religion,
yet they agreed well enough together in one common Principle, which was to
ſerve the preſent Turn, and preſerve themſelves: For though a great
part of the Nobility, and not a few of the Chief Gentry in the Houſe of
Commons were Cordially affected to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet were they
willing to give way to all ſuch Acts and Statutes as were made againſt it,
out of a fear of loſing ſuch Church Lands as they were poſſeſſed
of, if that Religion ſhould prevail, and get up again. And for the reſt,
who either were to make or improve their Fortunes, there is no queſtion to be
made, but that they came reſolved to further ſuch a Reformation as ſhould
moſt viſibly conduce to the advancement of their ſeveral ends; which
appears plainly by the ſtrange mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Acts</hi> and
<hi>Reſults</hi> thereof; ſome tending ſimply to God's Glory and the good
of the Church; ſome to the preſent benefit and enriching of particular
Perſons. And ſome again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deviſed of purpoſe to prepare a way for
expoſing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Church unto ſpoil and rapine. <hi>Heylin,

               <p>Anno 1551. <hi>Poynet</hi> was made Biſhop of
<hi>Wincheſter, Gardiner</hi> being deprived. Doctor <hi>Story</hi> was made
Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter. Miles Coverdal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter.
Hooper</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> So that now (ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>) the
Biſhopriks were generally filled with men well affected to the
<hi>Reformation. Burnet pag.</hi> 166. 2. <hi>vol. And <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47525:49"/>now
let the Reader obſerve his following words,</hi> viz. ſo now the Biſhops
being generally addicted to the Purity of Religion, moſt of this year (1551)
was ſpent in preparing <hi>Articles</hi> which ſhould contain the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But many thought (ſays he) they ſhould have begun 1. with
thoſe <hi>(Articles;)</hi> but <hi>Cranmer</hi> upon good reaſons was of
another mind, though much preſſed by <hi>Bucer</hi> about it, till the
Order of Biſhops <hi>(obſerve)</hi> were brought to ſuch a model, that
the far greater part of them would agree to it: it was much fitter to let that
deſign (<hi>of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles</hi>) go on ſlowly, than to ſet
out a Profeſſion of their Belief, to which ſo great a part of the chief
Paſtors might be obſtinately averſe. <hi>Burnet p.</hi> 166. 2.

               </p>
               <p>In the firſt year of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> (1559) the
Bill for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was paſt by the Lords on the 18th of <hi>March.</hi>
The Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> the
Biſhops of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Wincheſter, Worceſter, Landaff, Coventry</hi> and
<hi>Litcfield, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and the Abbot

                  <hi>He proceeds, p.</hi> 386. There was no other puniſhment
inflicted on thoſe that denied the Queens Supremacy (<hi>ann.</hi> 1559.) but
the loſs of their Goods, and ſuch as refuſed to take the Oath did only
loſe their Imployments. Whereas to refuſe the Oath in King <hi>Henrys</hi>
time brought them into a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and to deny the Supremacy was
Treaſon. But againſt this Bill (<hi>of Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>firſt
Parliament</hi>) the Biſhops made Speeches in the Houſe of Lords; the
reſt of the Biſhops oppoſed it, the rather becauſe they had lately
declared ſo high for the Pope, that it had been very indecent for them to
have revoked ſo ſoon, <hi>pag.</hi> 386, 387. 2. <hi>vol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſaid in Parliament, that
the Bill was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both Faith and Charity <hi>(meaning the Bill for the
new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)</hi> that <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> were no
Foundations for a Churches <hi>Belief;</hi> that it was an inſolent thing to
pretend that all our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> lived in Ignorance. That the Prophets
oftentimes directed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to enquire of their Fathers.
Matters of Religion <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47525:50"/>could not be underſtood by the
Laiety. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin when he ſet up a
new way of Worſhip. <hi>Gallie</hi> by the Light of Nature knew that a Civil
Judge ought not to meddle with matters of Religion. In the
<hi>Service-Book,</hi> that was then before them, there was no <hi>Sacrifice
for Sin, &amp;c.</hi> and for theſe reaſons (ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>) he
could not agree to it. But if any thought he ſpoke this becauſe of his own
concern, or pitied him for what he might ſuffer by it, he would anſwer in
the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Weep not for me, weep for your ſelves.</hi> p.
393.</p>
               <p>After him ſpake <hi>Fecknam</hi> Abbot of
<hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> he ſaid, There had been great Order and Obedience
in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> Reign: but now every where great Inſolencies were
committed by the people, with ſome very indecent Prophanations of the moſt
holy things. He recommended to them in St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words the
adhering to the Catholique Church: the very name <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> which
Heretiques had not the confidence to aſſume, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Authority. The
Conſent of the whole Church in all Ages with the perpetual
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Paſtors in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, ought to
weigh more with them than a few <hi>new Preachers,</hi> who had of late
diſtracted both <hi>Gemany</hi> and <hi>England. Burnet pag.</hi> 393. 2.

concerning Queen</hi> Eliſabeths <hi>Supremacy paſsed the Houſe of Lords
with great difficulty, all the Biſhops oppoſing them. Burnet</hi>
anſwers, It is true, all the Biſhops did oppoſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But to all the Changes that were made in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time they
ſubmitted, <hi>&amp;c. Why then were they turned out by King</hi> Edward,

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus,</hi> Reader, <hi>it appears by</hi> Burnets <hi>own
Confeſſion, that the</hi> Reformation <hi>was not the</hi> Act <hi>and</hi>
Deed <hi>of the old Clergy or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of</hi> England, <hi>or the major
part thereof; but impos'd on the</hi> Nation <hi>by the Power and Intereſt of

William Kings <hi>Confidence, the Preacher of St.</hi> Warbroughs,

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why, by this <hi>Conſecration</hi> he had no more Authority to

               <p>The matter is plain. All his <hi>Changes</hi> were

               <p>Reader, <hi>I pray look into the</hi> Form <hi>and</hi> Manner

               <p>
                  <hi>Now,</hi> Reader, <hi>remember that wonderful Anſwer
of</hi> Mas William Kings, <hi>page</hi> 18. <hi>viz.</hi>—Although
therefore the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> had their <hi>Orders</hi> from
Biſhops in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet it was as
Chriſtian Biſhops they ordained, and as Engliſh Biſhops that they
admitted the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> to their Charges. But ſuppoſe they
<hi>(the firſt Reformers)</hi> had no other Orders but what they received
from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; all that can be concluded from
thence, is, that we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to own that the Orders of <hi>Prieſt</hi>
and <hi>Biſhop</hi> given by <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are valid, and
capacitate a Man to perform all the Duties belonging to thoſe Offices in a
Chriſtian Church, which we readily acknowledge, <hi>(obſerve that)</hi> and
charge the Popiſh Prieſts and Biſhops not with want of <hi>Orders;</hi>
but with abuſing <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47525:52"/>the Orders they have to ill intents and
purpoſes; <hi>(by whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority do you paſs this Cenſure?)</hi> The
<hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Biſhops do not confer Orders as <hi>Roman,</hi> but
as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Biſhops; their Orders are Chriſtian Orders.
[<hi>Mark</hi> Reader <hi>what he ſays, Roman Catholick Biſhops are
Chriſtian Biſhops, and their Orders Chriſtian Orders; why then did the
firſt Reformers ſo notoriouſly tranſgreſs them?</hi>] And thoſe we
hold ſufficient to all intents and purpoſes of the <hi>Reformation;</hi>
and muſt do ſo till Mr. <hi>Manby</hi> or ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe prove them
inſufficient. In ſhort, a Man is ordained nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
nor a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Biſhop, his Miſſion
is a Chriſtian Miſſion, <hi>page</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>will be apt to ask, what needs
any more to recommend their Doctrine then Chriſtian Biſhops and a
Chriſtian Miſſion? Mr.</hi> King <hi>allows their Miſſion and denyes
their Doctrine.</hi> They deny both <hi>his</hi> Miſſion <hi>and his</hi>
Doctrine. <hi>When Doctrines are diſputed and</hi> Scriptures <hi>alledged by
both Parties, how ſhall a Church prove the</hi> verity <hi>of her Doctrine
but by the</hi> certainty <hi>of her Miſſion? Did not our bleſſed
Saviour anſwer that queſtion of the Jews,</hi> by what Authority doeſt
thou theſe thing? by <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the Evidence of his</hi> Miſſion?
The works that I do, teſtifie of me that I am ſent from God?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>King</hi>'s meaning is this, that Roman Catholicks
have exceeded their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> by teaching falſe Doctrine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But I would fain know of him, who ſhall be <hi>Judge</hi> of
that? he knows very well, that's as eaſily deny'd as 'tis affirm'd. And I
appeal to the indifferent Reader, which of the two Parties have been the
greateſt Tranſgreſſors of thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> now mentioned?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why, that Mr. <hi>M.</hi> proceeds on an ignorant
ſuppoſition, that every Man is ordained to preach the Tenets of his
<hi>Ordainers</hi>—Whereas the ordained are no more accountable to their
<hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers</hi> upon the account of being ordained by them, then a Man is
accountable to a Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> for the uſe of his power,

               <p>Let us adjourn this Diſcourſe till to Morrow. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this firſt Dialogue with <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Character of thoſe two worthy
Perſons that dyed for the Catholick Religion under <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Sir
<hi>Thomas More,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47525:53"/>On the firſt of <hi>July</hi>
(<hi>anno</hi> 1535.) Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> was brought to his Tryal. The
ſpecial matter of his Indictment was, that on the 7th of <hi>May</hi>
preceding, before <hi>Cromwell, Bedyll</hi> and ſome others that were
preſſing him concerning the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> he ſaid, he would
not meddle with any ſuch matter. And was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſerve God and
think upon his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and his own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of this
World. That he had alſo ſent divers Meſſages by one <hi>George
Gold</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> to encourage him in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
and ſaid, the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> is like a Sword with two
Edges; for if a man anſwer one way, it will confound his Soul, and if he
anſwer another way, it will confound his Body. That he had ſaid the ſame
thing on the third of <hi>June,</hi> in the hearing of the Lord
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and others. And that he would
not be the occaſion of the ſhortening his own Life.</p>
               <p>This and other particulars, which paſſed betwixt him and
<hi>Rich</hi> the Kings Sollicitor, were laid together, and judged to amount to
a Denyal of the Kings Supremacy. Judge <hi>Spelman</hi> writes, that
<hi>More</hi> being on his Tryal, pleaded ſtrongly againſt the Statute that
made it <hi>Treaſon</hi> to deny the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> and argued, that the
King could not be <hi>Supream Head</hi> of the Church. When he was brought to
the Bar, he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> but being found Guilty, Judgment was
given aganſt him as a <hi>Traitor.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it with an equal Temper
of Mind, which he had ſhewed in both conditions of Life; and then ſet
himſelf wholly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death. He expreſſed great Contempt of the
World: and that he was weary of Life, and long'd for Death; which was ſo
little terrible to him, that his ordinary Facetiouſneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with him
on the Scaffold. It was cenſured by many, as light and undecent; but others
ſaid, that way having been ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to him on all other occaſions, it
was not at all affected; but ſhewed that Death did no way diſcompoſe him;
nor ſo much as put him out of his ordinary Humour. Yet his rallying every
thing on the Scaffold, was thought to have more of the <hi>Stoick</hi> than the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47525:53"/>After ſome time ſpent in ſecret
Devotions, he was beheaded on the ſixth of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus dyed Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> in the 53d year of his age.
He was a man of rare Vertues and excellent Parts. In his youth he had freer
thoughts of things, as appears by his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> and his Letters to
<hi>Eraſmus;</hi> but afterwards he became ſuperſtitiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
(ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>) to the Intereſts and Paſſions of the Popiſh
Clergy; and as he ſerved them when he was in Authority, even to aſſiſt
them in all their Cruelties; ſo he employed his Pen in the ſame Cauſe,
both in writing againſt all the <hi>new Opinions</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and in
particular againſt <hi>Tindall, Frith</hi> and <hi>Barns.</hi> He was no
<hi>Divine</hi> at all (if you believe <hi>Burnet,</hi>) and it is plain to any
that reads his Writings, that he knew nothing of Antiquity, beyond the
Quotations he found in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Maſter</hi> of
the <hi>Sentences;</hi> only he had read ſome of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi>
Treatiſes: For upon all points of Controverſie he quotes only what he found
in thoſe Collections. Nor was was he at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the critical
Learning upon the Scriptures <hi>(he did not care for the new fangled Conceits
of the Reformers.)</hi> But his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Excellency in writing was, that he
had a natural, eaſie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and preſented all the Opinions of
<hi>Popery</hi> with their fair ſide to the Reader, diſguiſing, or
concealing the black ſide of them with great <hi>Art; (that is, he did not
underſtand, or miſtake Popery as Proteſtants do;)</hi> and was no leſs
dextrous in expoſing all the ill conſequences that could follow on the
Doctrine of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;</hi> and had upon all occaſions great ſtore
of pleaſant Tales, which he applied wittily to his purpoſe. And in this
conſiſts the great ſtrength of his Writings, which were deſigned rather
for the Rabble than for learned Men. But for Juſtice, Contempt of Mony,
Humility, and a true Generoſity of Mind, he was an Example to the Age in
which he lived. <hi>Burnets</hi> words, <hi>pag</hi> 356. 1 <hi>vol. Second
Edition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had been a Priſoner above
a year, and was very ſeverely uſed (ſays <hi>Burnet</hi>); he complained
in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Cromwell</hi> (then Secretary of State) that he had
neither <pb n="94" facs="tcp:47525:54"/>Clothes, nor Fire, being then about fourſcore
years of age.—If he had kept his Opinion of the Kings Supremacy to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they could not have proceeded further. He would not do that, but
did upon ſeveral occaſions ſpeak againſt it. So he was brought to his
Tryal on the 17th of <hi>June.</hi> The Lord <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> and ſome other Lords, together with the Judges, ſate upon
him by Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi> He pleaded Not
Guilty. But being found Guilty, Judgment paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on him to dye as a
Traytor. But he was by a Warrant from the King beheaded. Upon the 22d of
<hi>June</hi> being the day of his Execution, he dreſſed himſelf with
more than ordinary care; and when his Man took notice of it, he told him, he
was to be that day a <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> As he was led to the place of
Execution, being ſtop'd in the way by the croud, he opened his New
Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and prayed to this purpoſe, that as that Book had been his
Companion and chief Comfort in his Impriſonment, ſo then ſome place might
turn up to him, that might comfort him in his laſt paſſage. This being
ſaid, he opened the Book at a venture, in which theſe words of St.
<hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel turn'd up, <hi>This is Life eternal, to know thee the
only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So he ſhut
the Book with much ſatisfaction; and all the way was reading and meditating
on them. When he came to the Scaffold, he pronounced the <hi>Te Deum.</hi> And
after ſome other Devotions, his Head was cut off.</p>
               <p>Thus dyed <hi>Jon Fiſher,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in the 80th year of his age. He was a learned and devour
man (ſays <hi>Burnet,</hi>) but much addicted to the Superſtitions in which
he had been bred up, and that led him to great ſeverities againſt all that
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them. He had been for many years Confeſſor to the Kings
Grandmother the Counteſs of <hi>Richmond.</hi> And it was believed, that he
perſuaded her to thoſe noble deſigns fer the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning, of
founding 2 Colledges in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> St. <hi>Johns</hi> and
<hi>Chriſts</hi> Colledge; and <hi>Divinity Profeſſors</hi> in both
Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And in acknowledgement of this he was choſen
<hi>Chancellor</hi> of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge. Henry</hi> 7. gave
him the Biſhoprick <pb n="95" facs="tcp:47525:54"/>of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which he,
following the rule of the primitive Church, would never change for a better. He
uſed to ſay, his Church was his Wife, and he would never part with her,
becauſe ſhe was poor. He continued in great Favour with <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
till the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the <hi>Divorce</hi> was ſet on foot; and then he
adhered ſo firmly to the Queens Cauſe, and the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy,
that he was carried headlong into great Errors. So <hi>Burnet,</hi> after his
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant manner, is pleaſed to character this good man, <hi>pag.</hi> 354.

               <p>
                  <hi>But then adds.</hi> Many thought the King ought to have
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt him rather upon that which was a point of <hi>State,</hi>
than upon the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which was matter of <hi>Conſcienec:</hi>
but the King (ſaith he) was reſolved to let all his Subjects ſee, there
was no Mercy to be expected by any that denyed his being <hi>Supreme Head</hi>
of the Church: and therefore made him and Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> two Examples
for terrifying the reſt. <hi>Burnet ibid.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But the Courage and Chriſtian</hi> Soul <hi>of this
Biſhop appears in thoſe Speeches which he made in the Houſe of Lords,
whereof there is no mention in</hi> Burnet. <hi>Which, for the primitive</hi>

                        <p>I Pray you to take good heed unto what you are doing;
leſt you do you know not what. For indeed the things that are demanded at our
hands are not ours to grant, nor theirs to whom we ſhould beſtow them, if
we ſhould grant them their Deſires. But they are the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies of thoſe
Teſtators who have given them to the Church for ever, under the Penalty of a
heavy Curſe, impoſed on all thoſe who ſhall any way go about to
altenate their Property from the Church. And beſides, if we grant the
ſmaller Abbies to the King, what ſhould we do otherwiſe than ſhew him
the way how in time it may be lawful for him to demand the greater? Wherefore
the manner of theſe. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings puts me in mind of a <hi>Fable,</hi> how

Handle to work withal, and for that cauſe he was conſtrained to ſit idle.
Wherefore he made it his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt unto them, that they would grant him one of
their ſmaller <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> to make him a Handle. They, miſtruſting
no guile, granted him one of the ſmaller <hi>Trees;</hi> ſo becoming a

                        <p>And ſo, my Lords, if you grant the King theſe

Biſhops, Abbots, Prieſts and their Officials; but, my Lords, are all
vicious, all idle, all ravenous and cruel Prieſts or Biſhops? Are there not
Laws already provided againſt ſuch? is there any abuſe that cannot be
rectified? or can there be ſuch a <hi>Reformation,</hi> that there ſhall be
no Abuſes? are there not Clergymen to rectifie the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of the Clergy?
or ſhall men find fault with other mens manners whilſt they forget their
own? or puniſh where they have no Atho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to correct? If we be not
executive in our Laws, let each man ſuffer for his Delinquency. Or if we have
not Power, aid us with your Aſſiſtunce, and we ſhall give you thanks.
But, my Lords, I hear there is a Motion made, that the ſmaller
<hi>Monaſteries</hi> ſhould be taken into the <hi>Kings</hi> hands, which
makes me apprehend, it is not ſo much the <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>Goods</hi>
of the Church that are aim'd at.</p>
                        <p>Truly, my Lords, how this may ſound in your ears I
cannot tell; but to me it appears no otherwiſe, than as if our
<hi>Mother</hi> the Church were now to be brought into Servility; and by little
and little to <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47525:55"/>be baniſhed out of thoſe dwelling places
which the Piety &amp; Liberality of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> have conferred
upon her. Otherwiſe to what end are thoſe portentous and curious Petitions
of the <hi>Commons?</hi> To no other intent and purpoſe than to bring the
Clergy into contempt with the <hi>Laiety,</hi> that they may ſeize their
<hi>Patrimony.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But my Lords beware of Your Selves, and of Your Countrey:
Beware of Your Mother the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> The <hi>People</hi> are
addicted unto Novelties. And <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> ſpreads it ſelf amongst
us. Remember <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Bohemia;</hi> what Miſeries are
befallen them already; and let our Neighbours Houſes that are now on
<hi>Fire,</hi> teach us to beware of our own Diſaſters.</p>
                        <p>My Lords, I will tell you plainly what I think, that
except ye reſiſt manfully by your Authorities this violent <hi>Stream</hi>
of Miſchiefs offered by the <hi>Commons,</hi> you ſhall ſee all reſpect
firſt withdrawn from the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and, ſecondly from Your

                        <opener>
                           <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>IT is true, we are all under the King's Laſh, and
ſtand in need of the King's good Favour and Clemency. Yet this argues not
that we muſt therefore do that which will render us both ridiculous and
contemptible to all the <hi>Chriſtian World;</hi> and hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out from
the Society of Gods <hi>Holy Catholick Church:</hi> What good will it do us to
keep the Poſſeſſion of our Houſes, Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Convents, and to
loſe the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian World?</hi> To preſerve
our <hi>Goods,</hi> and loſe our <hi>Conſciences?</hi> Therefore <hi>My
Lords,</hi> I pray let us conſider what we are doing; and what it is we are
to Grant, with the Dangers and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences <pb n="98" facs="tcp:47525:56"/>that will
enſue thereupon. Or whether it lyes in Our power to grant what the
<hi>King</hi> requires at our hands. Whether the King be an apt perſon to
receive this Power, that ſo we may go groundedly to work; and not like Men
that had loſt all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Wit together with their Worldly Fortune.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> What the
<hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Church is, which we are to give unto the King. It is
to exerciſe the Spiritual Goverment of the Church in <hi>Chief,</hi> which
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that ever I have learned both in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and
through the whole courſe of <hi>Divinity,</hi> mainly conſiſts in theſe
two points.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, In Binding and Abſolving <hi>Sinners,</hi>
according to that which our Saviour ſaid unto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when he
ordained him <hi>Head</hi> of his Church, <hi>viz. To thee will I give the Keys
of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now <hi>My Lords,</hi> can we ſay unto the King, Tibi,
<hi>to thee will we give the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> If ye ſay,
I, where is your <hi>Warrant?</hi> If you ſay <hi>No,</hi> then you have
anſwered your Selves, that you cannot put ſuch <hi>Keys</hi> into his
hands.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Supream Government of the Church
conſiſts in feeding Chriſt's Sheep and Lambs; according to that, when our
Saviour performed his promiſe to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of making him
univerſal Shepherd, by ſuch unlimited Juriſdiction, <hi>feed my
Lambs;</hi> and not only ſo, but feed thoſe that are the feeders of thoſe
Lambs, <hi>feed my Sheep.</hi> Now my <hi>Lords</hi> can any of us ſay unto
the King <hi>paſce Oves?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God hath given unto his Church ſome to be
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſome <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Paſtors,</hi>
ſome <hi>Doctors</hi> for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt. So that you
muſt make the King one of theſe, before you can make him <hi>Head</hi> of
the Church. He muſt be ſuch a Head as may edifie the Members of Chriſt's
Body; and it is not the ſew Miniſters of an <hi>Iſland</hi> that muſt
conſtitute a Head over the Univerſe; or at leaſt by ſuch example we
muſt allow as many <hi>Heads</hi> over the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> as there
are <hi>Sovereign Powers</hi> within Chriſt's Dominion. Every <hi>Member</hi>
muſt have a Head. <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47525:56"/>
                           <hi>Attendite vobis</hi> was not ſaid
to King's but Biſhops.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the Inconveniencies that will
ariſe upon this Grant: We cannot grant this unto the <hi>King,</hi> but we
muſt renounce our Unity with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if there were no
further matter in it, then a renouncing of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. (now Pope
thereof) then the matter were not ſo great; but in this we do forſake the
firſt four General Councils; which none ever forſook. We renounce all
Canonical and Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Church of Chriſt; we renounce
all other Chriſtian Princes; we renounce the Unity of the Chriſtian World
(<hi>I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he means by inventing to our Selves a Church of</hi>
England <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from all the reſt of the Chriſtian World</hi>) and
ſo by leaping out of <hi>Peters</hi> Ship to be drowned in the unſtable
Waters of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> Sects, Schiſms and Confuſions.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt General Council of <hi>Nice</hi>
acknowledged <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his Authority
to be over them, by ſending their <hi>Decrees</hi> to be ratifyed by him.</p>
                        <p>The Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did acknowledge
Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> to be their <hi>Chief,</hi> by admitting him to give
Sentence againſt the Hereticks, <hi>Macedonius, Sabellius</hi> and
<hi>Eunomius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> acknowledged Pope
<hi>Celeſtine</hi> to be their chief Judge, by admitting his Condemnation
upon the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick <hi>Neſtorius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> acknowledged Pope
<hi>Leo</hi> to be their chief Head, and all General Councils of the World ever
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (only) to be Supream Head of the Church
under Chriſt. And now ſhall we ſet up another Head? or one Head in
<hi>England,</hi> and another in <hi>Rome?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. We deny all Eccleſiaſtical Laws which do
wholly depend upon the Authority of the Apoſtolick See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 We renounce the Judgment of all other Chriſtian
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether they be Proteſtants or Catholicks. Nay by this argument
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> muſt have been Heads of the Church of
Chriſt. The <hi>Emperour</hi> muſt be Head of the Proteſtant Church in
<hi>Germany.</hi> And the Church of Chriſt muſt have <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47525:57"/>never a Head at all till about three hundred years after Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly. The Kings Majeſty is not ſuſceptible of
this <hi>Donation: Ozias,</hi> for medling with the Prieſts Office, was
reſiſted by <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, thruſt out of the Temple,</hi> and told, that
<hi>it belongs not to his Office.</hi> Now, if the Prieſt ſpake truth in
this, then is not the <hi>King</hi> to meddle in this buſineſs: if he
ſpake amiſs, why did God plague the King with Leproſie for this, and not
the Prieſt?</p>
                        <p>King <hi>David,</hi> when the Ark of God was bringing
home, did he place himſelf in the head of the Prieſts Order? did he ſo
much as touch the Ark? or execute any the leaſt Office pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to
the Prieſtly Function? or did he not rather go before, and abaſe himſelf
amongſt the people, and ſay, that he would become yet more vile, ſo that
God might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
                        <p>All good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperors have evermore
refuſed <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Authority;</hi> for at the firſt General
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bills were privily brought unto
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to be ordered by his Authority; but he cauſed them to
be burnt, ſaying, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus vos conſtituit, &amp;c. God hath ordained
you</hi> (Prieſts) <hi>and hath given you Power to be Judges over us; and
therefore by right in theſe things we are to be judged by you, but you are
not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Valentine,</hi> the Good Emperor, was deſired by the
Biſhops to be preſent with them, to reform the Hereſie of the
<hi>Arrians;</hi> but he anſwered, Foraſmuch as I am one of the Members of
the <hi>Lay people, it is not lawful for me to define ſuch Controverſies;
but let the Prieſts, to whom God hath given the charge thereof, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
where they will in due Order.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> writing to the Council of
<hi>Epheſus;</hi> ſaith, It is not lawful for him that is not of the holy
Order of Biſhops, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> matters.
And now ſhall we cauſe our King to be <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, which
all good Kings have abhorred the very leaſt thought of? (and ſo many wicked
Kings <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47525:57"/>have been plagued for ſo doing.) Truly, my Lords,
I think they are his beſt Friends that diſſwade him from it; and he would
be the worſt enemy to himſelf, if he ſhould obtain it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly. If this thing be, farewel all Unity with
Chriſtendom; for as that holy and bleſſed Martyr St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
ſaith, all Unity depends upon that holy <hi>See,</hi> as upon the Authority
of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Succeſſors; for, ſaith the fame holy Father, all
Hereſies, Sects &amp; Schiſms, have no other Riſe but this, that men will
not be obedient to the chief Biſhop; and now for us to ſhake off our
Communion with that Church, either we muſt grant the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
to be the <hi>Church</hi> of God, or elſe a <hi>Malignant Church.</hi> If you
anſwer, ſhe is a Church of God, and a Church where Chriſt is truly
taught, his Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how can we
forſake, how can we fly from ſuch a Church? certainly we ought to be with,
and not to ſeparate our ſelves from ſuch a one.</p>
                        <p>If we anſwer, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not of God,
but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Church, then it will follow, that we, the Inhabitants of this
Land, have not as yet received the true <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt; ſeeing we
have not received any other Goſpel, any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, any other
Sacraments, than what we have received from her; as moſt evidently appears by
all the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtories: wherefore, if ſhe be a
<hi>Malignant</hi> Church, we have been deceived all this while; and if to
renounce the common Father of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> all the General
Councils, eſpecially the firſt Four, which none renounce, all the Countreys
of Chriſtendom, whether they be Catholique Countreys or Proteſtant, be to
forſake the Unity of the Chriſtian World, then is the granting of the
Supremacy of the Church unto the King, a renouncing of this Unity, a tearing of
the Seamleſs Coat of Chriſt in ſunder, a dividing of the Myſtical Body
of Chriſt his Spouſe, limb from limb, and tayl to tayl, like
<hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes, to ſet the Field of Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church all on
fire: and this is it which we are about; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it be ſaid unto you
in time, and not too late, <hi>Look you to that.</hi>
